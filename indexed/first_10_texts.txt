though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. at worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision, rendering obsolete the judicial process in question&mdash;[[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.  the [[rules of evidence]] are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. in a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.  all evidence must be relevant and not [[hearsay]] evidence.  peter murphy in his ''practical guide to evidence'' recounts an instructive example. a frustrated judge in an english (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'am i never to hear the truth?' 'no, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.  the name "adversarial system" may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. this is not the case, and both modern adversarial and inquisitorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. indeed, the [[european convention on human rights|european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms]] in article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.  the [[right to counsel]] in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. it was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. as a consequence, it was only in 1836 that england gave suspects of felonies the formal right to have legal counsel (the [[prisoners' counsel act 1836]]), although in practise english courts routinely allowed defendants to be represented by counsel from the mid-18th century. during the second half of the 18th century advocates like [[william garrow|sir william garrow]] and [[thomas erskine, 1st baron erskine]] helped usher in the adversarial court system used in most common law countries today. in the united states, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the [[united states constitution|constitution]] and in state cases at least since the end of the [[american civil war|civil war]], although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36 |title=crs/lii annotated constitution sixth amendment |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref> it was not until 1963 that the [[supreme court of the united states|u.s. supreme court]] declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal sixth amendment, in state courts. see ''[[gideon v. wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}.  one of the most significant differences between the adversarial system and the inquisitorial system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. in an adversarial system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocution]] of her or his crime; an obviously false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. by contrast, in an inquisitiorial system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. this allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversarial systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the united states are handled without trial through such plea bargains.  in some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make [[inference]]s on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question. this obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defense. in england the criminal justice and public order act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in england and wales (it was already possible in scotland under the [[rule of criminative circumstances]]). this change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. the criticism reflects the idea that if the accused can be inferred to be guilty by exercising their right to silence, it no longer confers the protection intended by such a right. in the united states, the [[fifth amendment to the united states constitution|fifth amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.  lord devlin in ''the judge'' said: "it can also be argued that two prejudiced searchers starting from opposite ends of the field will between them be less likely to miss anything than the impartial searcher starting at the middle."<ref>p devlin, ''the judge'' (oxford university press, 1970) 60-1</ref>  ==comparisons with the inquisitorial approach== there are many differences in the way cases are reviewed. it is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show whether or not these systems would come to the same results. however, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.  proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. it also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.  in addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. the common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in the courtroom. most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. the lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges.  proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. they point out that many cases in adversarial systems, and most cases in the united states, are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] or [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. plea bargain as a system does not exist in an inquisitorial system. many legal cases in adversarial systems, and most in the united states, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. in addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not.  ==see also== {{portal|law}} * [[exclusionary rule]] * [[parallel thinking]] - described as a systemic alternative  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== *{{cite book|author=kagan, robert a. |title=adversarial legalism: the american way of law| isbn=9780674012417|date=september 2003|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674012417|publisher=harvard university press|location=cambridge, ma}}  {{criminal procedure}}  {{defaultsort:adversarial system}} [[category:judiciaries]] [[category:legal systems]]Aeclanum | {{redirect|eclano|modern and nearby town|mirabella eclano}} {{infobox ancient site   |name = aeclanum   |native_name = eclano   |alternate_name =    |image = aeclanum (thermae-01).jpg   |alt =    |caption = view of the ''[[thermae]]'' with the ''[[opus reticulatum]]'' brickwork   |map_type = italy   |map_alt =    |coordinates = {{coord|41|3|14|n|15|0|40|e|display=inline,title}}   |location = [[mirabella eclano]] ([[province of avellino]], [[italy]])   |region = [[campania]]   |type = settlement   |part_of =    |length =    |width =    |area =    |height =    |builder =    |material =    |built =    |abandoned =    |epochs = [[roman republic]] - [[byzantine empire]]   |cultures = [[samnites]] - [[ancient rome]]   |dependency_of =    |occupants =    |event =    |excavations =    |archaeologists =    |condition =    |ownership =    |management = soprintendenza per i beni archeologici di salerno, avellino, benevento e caserta   |public_access = yes   |website = [http://www.cir.campania.beniculturali.it/luoghi-della-cultura/parco-archeologico-dellantica-aeclanum aeclanum]   |notes =  }} '''aeclanum''' (also spelled '''aeculanum''', {{lang-it|eclano}}, {{lang-gr|αικούλανον}})<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/eclano_%28enciclopedia_dell%27_arte_antica%29/ aeclanun] on the ''[[treccani|italian encyclopedia treccani]]''</ref> was an ancient town of [[samnium]], southern [[italy]], c. 25&nbsp;km east-southeast of [[benevento|beneventum]], on the [[via appia]]. it lies in [[passo di mirabella]], near the modern [[mirabella eclano]].  == location == [[file:aeclanum (ruins-03).jpg|thumb|left|200px|view of the town]] aeclanum was on a promontory naturally defended, to some extent, by a steep slope on the south side down to the river calore, while the north side lay open towards the crest of the ridge that carried what under the [[roman empire]] became the [[via appia]]. this led through [[ampsanctus|lacus ampsanctus]] to [[aquilonia, italy|aquilonia]] and [[venusia]]. another route to [[apulia]], the via aurelia aeclanensis diverged here, leading through modern [[ariano]] to [[herdoniae]]. the road from aeclanum to [[abellinum]] (mod.

the other two were "curule aediles" (latin ''aediles curules''), open to both plebeians and patricians, in alternating years. an ''aedilis curulis'' was classified as a ''magister curulis''.  the office of the aedilis was generally held by young men intending to follow the [[cursus honorum]] to high political office, traditionally after their [[quaestor]]ship but before their [[praetor]]ship. it was not a compulsory part of the cursus, and hence a former quaestor could be elected to the praetorship without having held the position of aedile. however, it was an advantageous position to hold because it demonstrated the aspiring politician's commitment to public service, as well as giving him the opportunity to hold public festivals and games, an excellent way to increase his name recognition and popularity.  ==history of the office== ===plebeian aediles=== the plebeian aediles were created in the same year as the [[tribune|tribunes of the people]] (494 bc). originally intended as assistants to the tribunes, they guarded the rights of the plebs with respect to their headquarters, the temple of ceres.  subsequently, they assumed responsibility for maintenance of the city's buildings as a whole.<ref>mccullough, 938</ref>  their duties at first were simply ministerial. they were the assistants to the tribunes in whatever matters that the tribunes might entrust to them, although most matters with which they were entrusted were of minimal importance. around 446 bc, they were given the authority to care for the decrees of the senate (''senatus consulta''). when a ''senatus consultum'' was passed, it would be transcribed into a document, and deposited in the public treasury, the ''[[aerarium]]''. they were given this power because the [[roman consul|roman consuls]], who had held this power before, arbitrarily suppressed and altered the documents.<ref name="liv. iii.55">liv. iii.55</ref> they also maintained the acts of the [[plebeian council]] (popular assembly), the "plebiscites". plebiscites, once passed, were also transcribed into a physical document for storage. while their powers grew over time, it is not always easy to distinguish the difference between their powers, and those of the [[roman censor|roman censors]]. occasionally, if a censor was unable to carry out one of his tasks, an aedile would perform the task instead.  ===curule aediles=== according to [[livy]] (vi. 42), after the passing of the [[lex licinia sextia|licinian rogations]] in 367 bc, an extra day was added to the roman games; the plebeian aediles refused to bear the additional expense, whereupon the patricians offered to undertake it, on condition that they were admitted to the aedileship. the plebeians accepted the offer, and accordingly two ''curule'' aediles were appointed—at first from the patricians alone, then from patricians and plebeians in turn, lastly, from either—at the [[tribal assembly]] under the presidency of the consul.<ref name="eb1911"/> curule aediles, as formal magistrates, held certain honors that plebeian aediles (who were not technically magistrates), did not hold. besides having the right to sit on a [[curule chair]] (''sella curulis'') and to wear a [[toga|toga praetexta]], the curule aediles also held the power to issue edicts (''jus edicendi''). these edicts often pertained to matters such as the regulation of the public markets, or what we might call "economic regulation".<ref>cic. verr. v.14</ref> [[livy]] suggests, perhaps incorrectly, that both curule as well as plebeian aediles were sacrosanct.<ref name="liv. iii.55"/> although the curule aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian, their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical.<ref name="eb1911"/> within five days after the beginning of their terms, the four aediles (two plebeian, two curule) were required to determine, by lot or by agreement among themselves, what parts of the city each should hold jurisdiction over.<ref>tabul. heracl. ed. mazoch</ref>  ===differences between the two=== there was a distinction between the two sets of aediles when it came to public festivals. some festivals were plebeian in nature, and thus were under the superintendence of plebeian aediles.<ref>liv. xxxi.56</ref> other festivals were supervised exclusively by the curule aediles,<ref>liv. xxxi.50</ref> and it was often with these festivals that the aediles would spend lavishly. this was often done so as to secure the support of voters in future elections. because aediles were not reimbursed for any of their public expenditures, most individuals who sought the office were independently wealthy. since this office was a stepping stone to higher office and the senate, it helped to ensure that only wealthy individuals (mostly landowners) would win election to high office. these extravagant expenditures began shortly after the end of [[second punic war]], and increased as the spoils returned from rome's new eastern conquests. even the decadence of the emperors rarely surpassed that of the aediles under the republic, as could have been seen during [[julius caesar|julius caesar's]] aedileship.<ref>plut. caesar, 5</ref>  ==election to the office== plebeian aediles were elected by the [[plebeian council]] (popular assembly), usually while under the presidency of a [[plebeian tribune]]. curule aediles were elected by the [[tribal assembly]], usually while under the presidency of a [[roman consul]]. since the plebeian aediles were elected by the [[plebeians]] (commoners), rather than by all of the [[spqr|people of rome]] (plebeians as well as members of the [[patrician (ancient rome)|patrician]] aristocracy), they were not technically [[roman magistrate|magistrates]]. before the passage of the ''lex annalis'', individuals could run for the aedileship by the time they turned twenty-seven. after the passage of this law in 180 bc, a higher age was set, probably thirty-five.<ref>liv. xl.44</ref> by the 1st century bc, aediles were elected in july, and took office on the first day in january.  ==powers of the office== [[cicero]] ([[de legibus|legg.]] iii. 3, 7) divides these functions under three heads:  (1) care of the city: the repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of [[sumptuary]] laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions and the registration of [[meretrix|meretrices]].  they also punished those who had too large a share of the [[ager publicus]], or kept too many cattle on the state pastures.
