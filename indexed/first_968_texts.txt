(psf).png|thumb|right|abatisses are used in war to keep the approaching enemy under fire for as long as possible.]]  an '''abatis''', '''abattis''', or '''abbattis''' is a field [[fortification]] consisting of an obstacle formed (in the modern era) of the branches of trees laid in a row, with the sharpened tops directed outwards, towards the enemy. the trees are usually interlaced or tied with [[wire]]. abatis are used alone or in combination with [[wire entanglement]]s and other obstacles.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  == history == [[file:abatis.jpg|thumb|abatis improvised by japanese troops during [[world war ii]]]]  there is evidence it was used as early as the [[roman empire|roman imperial]] period, and as recently as the [[american civil war]].<ref>personal memoirs of u. s. grant, complete, ch. xxii</ref>  a classic use of an abatis was at the [[battle of carillon]] during the seven years' war. the 3,600 french troops defeated a massive army of 16,000 british and colonial troops by fronting their defensive positions with an extremely dense abatis. the british found the defences almost impossible to breach and were forced to withdraw with some 2,600 casualties. other uses of an abatis can be found at the [[battle of the chateauguay]], 26 october 1813, when approximately 1,300 [[canadian voltigeurs|canadian voltigeurs]], under the command of charles-michel de salaberry, defeated an american corps of approximately 4,000 men, or at the [[battle of plattsburgh]].  == construction == [[file:giant abatis.jpg|thumb|upright|giant abatis, made from entire trees, can make an effective anti-vehicle obstacle. this formation can be achieved by use of explosives—note the splintered stumps]]  an important weakness of abatis, in contrast to [[barbed wire]], is that it can be destroyed by [[fire]]. also, if laced together with [[rope]] instead of [[wire]], the rope can be very quickly destroyed by such fires, after which the abatis can be quickly pulled apart by [[grappling hook]]s thrown from a safe distance.  an important advantage is that an improvised abatis can be quickly formed in forested areas. this can be done by simply cutting down a row of trees so that they fall with their tops toward the enemy. an alternative is to place explosives so as to blow the trees down.  == modern use == [[file:the boys of '61; or, four years of fighting. personal

symbol for an abatis]]  abatis are rarely seen nowadays, having been largely replaced by [[wire obstacle]]s. however, it may be used as a replacement or supplement when [[barbed wire]] is in short supply. a form of giant abatis, using whole trees instead of branches, can be used as an improvised anti-[[tank]] obstacle.  though rarely used by modern conventional military units, abatises are still officially maintained in [[united states army]] and [[united states marine corps|marine corps]] training.  current us training instructs engineers or other constructors of such obstacles to fell trees, leaving a {{convert|1|or|2|yard||1}} stump, in such a manner as the trees fall interlocked pointing at a 45-degree angle towards the direction of approach of the enemy.  furthermore, it is recommended that the trees remain connected to the stumps and the length of roadway covered be at least {{convert|80|yard|round=5}}. us military maps record an abatis by use of an inverted "v" with a short line extending from it to the right.<ref>[[united states army]] and [[united states marine corps]], ''fm 101-5-1/mcrp 5-2a operational terms and graphics'', 30 september 1997</ref>  == see also

{{andalusia-geo-stub}}Abdominalsurgery | {{refimprove|date=october 2013}} the term '''abdominal surgery''' broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the [[abdomen]].  surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see [[stomach]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], etc.) diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. [[appendicitis]]).  == types == the most common abdominal surgeries are described below.  *[[appendectomy]]—surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the [[vermiform appendix|appendix]].  typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis, although sometimes the appendix is prophylactically removed incidental to another abdominal procedure. *[[caesarean section]] (also known as c-section) is a surgical procedure in which one or more incisions are made through a mother's abdomen (laparotomy) and uterus (hysterotomy) to deliver one or more babies, or, rarely, to remove a dead fetus. *[[inguinal hernia surgery]]—this refers to the repair of an [[inguinal hernia]]. *exploratory [[laparotomy]]—this refers to the opening of the [[abdominal cavity]] for direct examination of its contents, for example, to locate a source of bleeding or [[physical trauma|trauma]]. it may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem. *[[laparoscopy]]—a [[minimally invasive]] approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity. the tubes allow introduction of a small camera, surgical instruments, and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen. the abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and, often, a small video camera is used to show the procedure on a monitor in the operating room.  the surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy ([[gallbladder]] removal), the most common laparoscopic procedure.  the laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional "open"  == complications == complications of abdominal surgery include, but are not limited to: * [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] (also called scar tissue): complications of postoperative adhesion formation are frequent, they have a large negative effect on patients’ health, and increase workload in clinical practice<ref name=broek>{{cite journal |vauthors =broek r, issa y, van santbrink e, bouvy n |title=burden of adhesions in abdominal and pelvic surgery: systematic review and met-analysis |journal=bmj |volume=347 |issue= |pages=f5588 |year=2013 |pmid= |doi=10.1136/bmj.f5588 |display-authors=etal|hdl=2066/125383}}</ref>  * [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] * [[infection]] * [[paralytic ileus]] (sometimes called [[ileus]]): short-term paralysis of the bowel * [[perioperative mortality]] (death) * [[shock (circulatory)|shock]]  sterile technique, [[aseptic]] post-operative care, [[antibiotics]], use of the [[who surgical safety checklist]], and vigilant post-operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications.  planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions.  the contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.  globally, there are few studies comparing [[perioperative mortality]] following abdominal surgery across different health systems. one major prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency [[laparotomy]] from 357 centres in 58 high-, middle-, and low-income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-hdi countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors.<ref name=globalsurg2016>{{cite journal|vauthors=((globalsurg collaborative))|title=mortality of emergency abdominal surgery in high-, middle- and low-income countries|journal=british journal of

at 24 hours (high 1·1 per cent, middle 1·9 per cent, low 3·4 per cent; p < 0·001), increasing to 5·4 per cent by 30 days (high 4·5 per cent, middle 6·0 per cent, low 8·6 per cent; p < 0·001). of the 578 patients who died, 404 (69·9 per cent) did so between 24 h and 30 days following surgery (high 74·2 per cent, middle 68·8 per cent, low 60·5 per cent). patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role, with use of the [[who surgical safety checklist]] associated with reduced mortality at 30 days.  taking a similar approach, a unique global study of 1,409 children undergoing emergency [[laparotomy]] from 253 centres in 43 countries showed that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-hdi and middle-hdi countries compared with high-hdi countries, translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed in these settings. internationally, the most common operations performed were [[appendectomy]], [[small bowel resection]], [[pyloromyotomy]] and correction of [[intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]]. after adjustment for patient and hospital risk factors, child mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in low-hdi (adjusted or 7.14 (95% ci 2.52 to 20.23), p<0.001) and middle-hdi (4.42 (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared with high-hdi countries. <ref

lovecraft himself or the phillips' family lawyer albert baker.<ref>harms, p. 7, ''the encyclopedia cthulhiana''.</ref>  ''[[abdul]]'' is a common arabic name component [meaning servant of the powerful] but never a name by itself.

"haḍra" is also the name of the sufi [[dhikr#sufi view|dhikr]]<ref>[[abu al-abbas al-mursi]], the alexandrian andalusian sufi from the 13th century ce, is

game)|call of cthulhu]]'' [[tabletop role-playing game]] speculates that it may be a corruption of ''abd al-azrad'', which it claims translates to ''the worshipper of the great devourer''{{citation needed|date=august 2016}}.  the phrase "mad arab", sometimes with both words capitalized in lovecraft's stories, is used so commonly before alhazred's name that it almost constitutes a title. a reference to the "mad arab" in [[cthulhu mythos]] fiction is invariably a synonym for abdul alhazred. later writers sometimes preface alhazred with words such as "monk" (such as in the [[chick publications|chick]] parody tract [http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=135 "who will be eaten first?"] by [[howard hallis]]) or "scholar" replacing arab to avoid any racist overtones{{citation needed|date=august 2016}}.  ==biography== {{unreferenced section|date=august 2016}}  ===h. p. lovecraft=== {{wikisource|history of the necronomicon}} according to lovecraft's "history of the necronomicon" (written 1927, first published [[1938 in literature|1938]]), alhazred was:  :a mad poet of [[sanaá]], in [[yemen]], who is said to have flourished during the period of the [[umayyad caliphate|ommiade]] [[caliphate|caliphs]], circa 700 a.d. he visited the ruins of [[babylon]] and the subterranean secret of [[memphis, egypt|memphis]] and spent ten years alone in the great southern desert of [[arabia]]&mdash;the [[rub' al khali|roba el khaliyeh]] or "empty space" of the ancients&mdash;and "[[ad-dahna desert|dahna]]" or "crimson" desert of the modern arabs, which is held to be inhabited by protective evil spirits and monsters of death. of this desert many strange and unbelievable marvels are told by those who pretend to have penetrated it. in his last years alhazred dwelt in [[damascus]].  in 730, while still living in damascus, alhazred supposedly wrote a book of ultimate evil in [[arabic language|arabic]], ''al-azif'', which would later become known as the ''necronomicon''. those who have dealings with this book usually come to an unpleasant end, and alhazred was no exception. again according to lovecraft's "history":  :of his final death or disappearance (738 a.d.) many terrible and conflicting things are told. he is said by [[ibn khallikan|ebn khallikan]] (12th cent. biographer) to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses. of his madness many things are told. he claimed to have seen the fabulous [[iram of the pillars|irem]], or city of pillars, and to have found beneath the ruins of [[the nameless city|a certain nameless desert town]] the shocking annals and secrets of a race older than mankind. he was only an indifferent [[muslim|moslem]], worshipping unknown entities whom he called [[yog-sothoth]] and [[cthulhu]].  ===august derleth===  [[august derleth]] later made alterations to the biography of alhazred, such as redating his death to 731. derleth also changed alhazred's final fate, as described in his [[short story]] "[[the trail of cthulhu|the keeper of the key]]", first published in may [[1951 in literature|1951]]. in the story, [[the trail of cthulhu#laban shrewsbury|professor laban shrewsbury]] (a recurring derleth character) and his assistant at the time, [[the trail of cthulhu#nayland colum|nayland colum]], discover alhazred's burial site.  while the two are heading a caravan from [[salalah]], [[oman]], they cross the border into [[yemen]] and find the unexplored desert area that the ''necronomicon'' calls "roba el ehaliyeh" or "roba el khaliyeh" — presumably a reference to the [[empty quarter]] or "rub al khali".  at the center of the area they discover the nameless city (the setting of [[the nameless city|the lovecraft story of the same name]]) and in derleth's text the domain of the [[great old one]] [[hastur]]. shrewsbury, an old agent of hastur and the devoted enemy of hastur's half-brother, cthulhu, crosses its gates in search of alhazred's burial site.  he indeed finds alhazred's [[burial chamber]] and learns of his fate. alhazred had been kidnapped in [[damascus]] and brought to the nameless city, where he had earlier studied and learned some of the ''necronomicon''{{'}}s lore. as punishment for betraying their secrets, alhazred was tortured. then they blinded him, severed his tongue and executed him.  although the entrance to the chamber warns against disturbing him, shrewsbury opens alhazred's [[sarcophagus]] anyway, finding that only rags, bones, and dust remain of alhazred. however, the sarcophagus also contains alhazred's personal, incomplete copy of the ''necronomicon'', written in the [[arabic alphabet]]. shrewsbury then uses [[necromancy]] to recall alhazred's spirit and orders it to draw a map of the world as he knew it. after obtaining the map, which reveals the location of [[r'lyeh]] and other secret places, shrewsbury finally lets alhazred return to his eternal rest.  ==see also== *[[alchemy and chemistry in islam]] *[[islamic astrology]] *[[abdul alhazred (comics)]] *[[alhazred (novel)]] *[[sana'a manuscripts]]

about the relation between the absolute and god.}}</ref> and believed that it had various [[mathematical]] properties, including the [[reflection principle]]: every property of the absolute infinite

first, as it is realized in the supreme perfection, in the completely independent, extrawordly existence, in deo, where i call it absolute infinite or simply absolute; second to the extent that it is represented in the dependent, creatural world; third as it can be conceived in abstracto in thought as a mathematical magnitude, number or ordertype. in the latter two relations, where it obviously reveals itself as limited and capable for further proliferation and hence familiar to the finite, i call it ''[[transfinite number|transfinitum]]'' and strongly contrast it with the absolute.<ref>https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/lehre/phima10/quellentexte/handout-phima-teil4b.pdf<br/>translated quote from german: {{quote|es wurde das aktual-unendliche (a-u.) nach drei

nenne; zweitens, sofern es in der abhängigen, kreatürlichen welt vertreten ist; drittens, sofern es als mathematische größe, zahl oder ordnungstypus vom denken in abstracto aufgefaßt werden kann. in den beiden letzten beziehungen, wo es offenbar als beschränktes, noch weiterer vermehrung fähiges und insofern dem endlichen verwandtes a.-u. sich darstellt, nenne ich es ''transfinitum'' und setze es dem absoluten strengstens entgegen.}}[ca-a, p. 378].</ref>}}  cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[richard dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in

sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity i call for short a "sequence".<br /> <br /> ...<br /> <br /> now i envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''ω''.<br /> <br /> ...<br /> <br /> the system ''ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".<br /> now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''ω′'':<br /> <br /> 0, 1, 2, 3, ... &omega;<sub>0</sub>, &omega;<sub>0</sub>+1, ..., &gamma;, ... <br /> of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (the sequence ''ω'' has this property first for ω<sub>0</sub>+1. [ω<sub>0</sub>+1 should be ω<sub>0</sub>.])<br /> <br /> now ''ω&prime;'' (and therefore also ''ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. for if ''ω&prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''ω'', because it comprises all numbers. thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. therefore:<br /> <br /> ''the system ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}  == the burali-forti paradox == {{main|burali-forti paradox}} the idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. this is related to [[burali-forti paradox|cesare burali-forti's "paradox"]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. all of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. however, as in cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.  more generally, as noted by [[a.w. moore (mathematician)|a.w. moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.  a standard solution to this problem is found in [[zermelo set theory|zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (zermelo's [[axiom schema of specification|axiom of separation]]). this allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.  while this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. it seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. although zermelo's fix allows a [[class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. for example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. this is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[new foundations#how nf.28u.29 avoids

the property. it reveals no breaks{{clarify|reason= does this mean "it shews an unbroken chain"?|date=february 2011}}in the chain of legal ownership. after the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. in a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. after this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.  ==patent law== in the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through

through amendments of the plo's goals, which were seen as a step towards compromise with [[israel]]. abu nidal then moved to [[ba'athist iraq]] where he set up the ano, which soon began a vicious string of terrorist attacks.  it hasn't clearly defined its ideological position, but was clearly opposed to any form of compromise or negotiation with israel. it is known as one of the most uncompromisingly militant palestinian groups ever. it had an estimated membership of several hundred, but its strength today is not known.  ==ano attacks== {{main|list of attacks attributed to abu nidal|abu nidal internal executions}} the ano carried out attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring almost 1650 persons. targets include the united states, the united kingdom, france, israel, moderate [[palestinian diaspora|palestinians]], the [[plo]], and various [[arab world|arab]] and european countries. the group has not attacked western targets since the late 1980s.  major attacks included the [[rome and vienna airport attacks]] in december 1985, the [[neve shalom synagogue]] in [[istanbul]] and the [[pan am flight 73]] hijacking in [[karachi]] in september 1986, and the ''[[city of poros (ship)|city of poros]]'' day-excursion ship attack in greece in july 1988.  the ano has been especially noted for its uncompromising stance on negotiation with israel, treating anything less than all-out military struggle against israel as treachery. this led the group to perform numerous attacks against the plo, which had made clear it accepted a negotiated solution to the conflict. fatah-rc is believed to have assassinated plo deputy chief [[abu iyad]] and plo security chief abu hul in [[tunis]] in january 1991. it assassinated a [[jordan]]ian diplomat in [[lebanon]] in january 1994 and has been linked to the killing of the plo representative there. noted plo moderate [[issam sartawi]] was killed by the fatah-rc in 1983. in the late 1970s, the group also made failed assassination attempt on the present palestinian [[president of the palestinian national authority|president]] and plo chairman, [[mahmoud abbas]]. these attacks, and numerous others, led to the plo issuing a death sentence ''in absentia'' against abu nidal. in the early 1990s, it made an attempt to gain control of a refugee camp in [[lebanon]], but this was thwarted by plo organizations.

initiated by 1st century bc scholar [[marcus terentius varro]]. varro may have used the consular list with its mistakes and called the year of the first consuls "245 ''ab urbe condita''", accepting the 244-year interval from [[dionysius of halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of rome. the correctness of varro's calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.  from emperor [[claudius]] (ruled 41–54) onwards, varro's calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honour of the city's anniversary, in 48 [[anno domini|ad]], 800 years after the founding of the city.{{cn|date=june 2016}} [[hadrian]] and [[antoninus pius]] held similar celebrations, in 121 and 147/148 respectively.{{cn|date=june 2016}}  in 248, [[philip the arab]] celebrated rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[ludi saeculares]] for rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum]]. [[coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. a coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[pacatianus]], explicitly states "year one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''saeculum novum''.  when the roman empire turned christian in the 4th century, the imagery came to be used in a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense, and removed legal impediments to the development and public use of the ''[[anno domini]]'' dating system, which came into general use during the reign of [[charlemagne]].  ==relationship with anno domini== the [[anno domini]] (ad) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[dionysius exiguus]] in rome in 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of easter. in his easter table the year 532 was equated with the regnal year 248 of emperor diocletian. the table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[diocletian]] on 20 november 284, or as stated by dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione domini nostri jesu christi annorum tempora praenotare…''" ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our lord jesus christ …").<ref>''liber de paschate'', [[jacques paul migne|migne]], ''[[patrologia latina]]'',

flotation, together with the [[vacuole]]s in the ectoplasm, which often contain [[zooxanthella]]e.  ==classification by spine arrangement== the arrangement of the spines is very precise, and is described by what is called the müllerian law, which can be described in terms of lines of latitude and longitude – the spines lie on the intersections between five of the former, symmetric about an equator, and eight of the latter, spaced uniformly.  each line of longitude carries either two ''tropical'' spines or one ''equatorial'' and two ''polar'' spines, in alternation.  the way that the spines are joined together at the center of the cell varies and is one of the primary characteristics by which acanthareans are classified. * [[holacanthida]] – diametric spines, simply crossed *

nobel prize-winning physicist [[alfred kastler]] served as the organization's first chairman.  the group initially provided assistance to [[afghanistan refugees]] in [[pakistan]], famine-stricken [[ugandan]] communities, and [[cambodia]]n refugees in [[thailand]]. it expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in africa, the middle east, southeast asia, the balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. action against hunger's scientific committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula ([[f-100 (food)|f100]]), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat [[acute malnutrition]]. as a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.<ref>{{cite journal|title=definition and

language|greek]]: ἄκτιον) was the name of an ancient town on a [[promontory]] of western greece in northwestern [[acarnania]], at the mouth of the [[gulf of arta|ambracian gulf]]). actium is chiefly famous as the name given to the nearby naval [[battle of actium]], in which [[caesar augustus|octavian]] won a decisive victory over [[mark antony]] on september 2, 31 bc.  actium was situated on the southern side of the strait opposite the later city of [[nicopolis]] built by [[caesar augustus|octavian]].<ref>http://www.enotes.com/occc-encyclopedia/actium</ref> since 2002 the peninsular of actium has been linked with [[preveza]] on the north shore of the [[ambracian gulf]] by the [[aktio-preveza undersea tunnel]].  ==history== [[file:castro battle of actium.jpg|thumb|[[battle of actium]] by [[laureys a castro]], 1672. note anachronisms.]] actium belonged originally to the [[ancient corinth|corinth]]ian colonists of [[anactorium]], who probably founded the sanctuary of apollo actius.<ref>e. kristen: "the origins of the first inhabitants of nicopolis", proceedings of the first international symposium on nicopolis, 1984</ref> in the 3rd century bc it fell to the [[acarnanians]], who subsequently held their religious summits there.  on the promontory was the ancient sanctuary of [[apollo|apollo actius]], which was later enlarged by augustus, and also the town of actium.  octavian also ordered a war monument to be constructed to commemorate his victory at the battle of actium in 31 bc on the site of his campsite prior to the naval engagement, near nicopolis.<ref>dio cassius, roman history, 51.1.3</ref>  octavian instituted or renewed the games known as [[actia]] or [[ludi]] actiaci, named after actium in nicopolis (the new city) to memorialise the battle.  actiaca aera was a computation of time from the battle.  ==archaeology== in  1980 the greek ministry of transport and communications reported that shipwrecks from the battle of actium had been located at actium near the entrance to the ambracian gulf.  in summer 2009 archaeologists discovered the ruins of the temple of apollo and found two statue heads, one of apollo, one of artemis (diana).<ref>dr. harry gouvas:history of preveza prefecture, 2009, {{isbn|978-960-87328-2-7}}</ref>  ==see also==  *[[battle of actium]]  {{coord|38.953|n|20.768|e|display=title|source:dewiki}}

[[asp.net]], first released in january 2002, has superseded asp.  == history == initially released as an add-on to [[internet information services]] (iis) via the [[windows nt 4.0#option pack|windows nt 4.0 option pack]] (ca. 1996), it is included as a free component of [[windows server]] (since the initial release of [[windows 2000 server]]). there have been three versions of asp, each introduced with different versions of iis:<ref>http://www.visualsolutions-co.com/services/what-is-asp.php</ref>  * asp 1.0 was released on december 1996 as part of iis 3.0 * asp 2.0 was released on september 1997 as part of iis 4.0 * asp 3.0 was released on november 2000 as part of iis 5.0  asp 2.0 provides six built-in [[object (computer science)|objects]]: application, asperror, request, response, server, and session. <code>session</code> object, for example, represents a [[session (computer science)|session]] that maintains the state of [[variable (programming)|variables]] from page to page.<ref>the session data is kept server-side, the id is saved as a [[http cookie]]. source: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972338.aspx asp and web session management], microsoft</ref> the [[active scripting]] engine's support of the [[component object model]] (com) enables asp [[website]]s to access functionality in compiled [[library (computing)|libraries]] such as [[dynamic-link library|dlls]].  asp 3.0 does not differ greatly from asp 2.0 but it does offer some additional enhancements such as server.transfer method, server.execute method, and an enhanced asperror object. asp 3.0 also enables buffering by default and optimized the engine for better performance.  asp remains supported until 14 january 2020 on [[windows 7]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=active server pages

is sent to the client's web browser. the asp interpreter reads and executes all script code between <% and %> tags, the result of which is content generation. these scripts were written using [[vbscript]], [[jscript]], or [[perlscript]]. the <code>@language</code> directive, the {{tag|script|s|params=language="manu" runat="server"}} syntax or server configuration can be used to select the language. in the example below, response.write now() is in an [[html]] page; it would be dynamically replaced by the current time of the server. {| ! server side !! what client receives |-

common ''.htm'' or ''.html'' extensions. pages with the ''.aspx'' extension use compiled [[asp.net]]; however, asp.net pages may still include some asp scripting. the introduction of asp.net led to use of the term ''classic asp'' for the original technology.  asp runs only on [[windows]].  a number of products emulate some of the functionality of classic asp on non-microsoft web servers.  apache::asp for example ports classic asp to the apache web server, but can only interpret [[perlscript]].<ref>{{cite web|title=apache::asp|url=http://www.apache-asp.org/index.html|accessdate=9

authors. the honorary name of ''magister adam'' shows that he had passed through all the stages of a higher education. it is probable that he was taught at the ''[[magdeburg]]er domschule''.  in 1066

expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past.  for example, if inflation has been higher than expected in the past, people would revise expectations for the future.  one simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation, where <math>p^e</math> is the next year's [[expected inflation|rate of inflation that is currently expected]]; <math>p^e_{-1}</math>is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; and <math>p</math> is this year's actual rate of inflation:  ::<math>p^e = p^{e}_{-1} + \lambda (p - p^{e}_{-1})</math>  where <math>\lambda</math> is between 0 and 1. this says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an "error-adjustment" term, in which current expectations are raised (or lowered) according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations.  this error-adjustment is also called "''partial adjustment''."  the theory of adaptive expectations can be applied to all previous periods so that current inflationary expectations equal:  ::<math>p^e = \lambda \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} ((1-\lambda)^j p_j)</math>  where <math>p_j</math> equals actual inflation <math>j</math> years in the past. thus, current expected inflation reflects a weighted average of all past inflation, where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past.  once a forecasting error is made by agents, due to a stochastic shock, they will be unable to correctly forecast the price level again even if the price level experiences no further shocks since they only ever incorporate part of their errors. the backward nature of expectation formulation and the resultant systematic errors made by agents (see [[cobweb model]]) was unsatisfactory to economists such as [[john muth]], who was pivotal in the development of an alternative model of how expectations are formed, called [[rational expectations]]. this has largely replaced adaptive expectations in macroeconomic theory since its assumption of optimality of expectations is consistent with economic theory. however, it must be stressed that confronting adaptivity and rationality is not necessarily justified, in other words, there are situations in which following the adaptive scheme is a rational response.  adaptive expectations were instrumental in the [[phillips curve]] outlined by [[milton friedman]]. for friedman, workers form adaptive expectations, so the government can easily surprise them through unexpected monetary policy changes. as agents are trapped by the [[money illusion]], they are unable to correctly perceive price and wage dynamics, so, for friedman, unemployment can always be reduced through monetary expansions. the result is an increasing level of inflation if the government chooses to fix unemployment at a low rate for an extended period of time. however, in this framework it is clear why and how adaptive expectations are problematic. agents are arbitrarily supposed to ignore sources of information which, otherwise, would affect their expectations. for example, government announcements are such sources: agents are expected to modify their expectations and break with the former trends when changes in economic policy necessitate it. this is the reason why the theory of adaptive expectations is often regarded as a deviation from the rational tradition of economics.<ref>{{cite book |last=galbács |first=peter |title=the theory of new classical macroeconomics. a positive critique |location=heidelberg/new

toulouse]]).]]  '''adhemar''' (also known as '''adémar''', '''aimar''', or '''aelarz''') '''de monteil''' (died 1 august 1098) was one of the principal figures of the [[first crusade]] and was [[bishop of puy-en-velay]] from before 1087. he was the chosen representative of [[pope urban ii]] for the expedition to the holy land. remembered for his martial prowess, he led knights and men into battle and fought beside them, particularly at [[battle of dorylaeum (1097)|dorylaeum]] and [[siege of antioch|antioch]]. adhemar is said to have carried the [[holy lance]] in the crusaders’ desperate breakout at antioch on 28 june 1098, in which superior islamic forces under the atabeg kerbogha were routed, securing the city for the crusaders.  ==life== born around 1045 into the family of the [[county of valentinois|counts of valentinois]] and elected bishop of le puy around 1080, he was an advocate of the [[gregorian reform]], and among his supporters were the future [[pope urban ii]] and [[raymond iv, count of toulouse|raymond of saint-gilles]], count of toulouse and the richest, most powerful nobleman in france. he was also said to have gone on pilgrimage to [[jerusalem]] around 1086.  at the [[council of clermont]] in 1095, adhemar showed great zeal for the crusade (there is evidence that urban ii had conferred with adhemar before the council).{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} adhemar was named [[apostolic legate]] and appointed to lead the crusade by pope urban ii on 27 november 1095.{{sfn|peters|1971|p=31}}  in part, adhemar was selected to lead because he had already undertaken a pilgrimage to jerusalem in 1086 and 1087.{{sfn|peters|1971|p=31}}  departing on 15 august 1096,{{sfn|peters|1971|p=31}} he accompanied [[raymond iv of toulouse|raymond iv]], [[count of toulouse]], in his [[army of raymond of saint-gilles|army]] to the east.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  whilst raymond and the other leaders often quarrelled with each other over the leadership of the crusade, adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader of the crusade.  adhemar negotiated with [[alexius i comnenus]] at [[constantinople]], reestablished some discipline among the crusaders at [[iznik|nicaea]], fought a crucial role at the [[battle of dorylaeum (1097)|battle of dorylaeum]] and was largely responsible for sustaining morale during the [[siege of antioch]] through various religious rites including fasting and special observances of holy days. after the capture of [[antioch|the city]] in june 1098 and the subsequent siege led by [[kerbogha]], adhemar organized a procession through the streets and had the gates locked so that the crusaders, many of whom had begun to panic, would be unable to leave the city. he was extremely skeptical of [[peter bartholomew]]'s discovery in antioch of the [[holy lance]], especially because he knew such a relic already existed in constantinople; however, he was willing to let the crusader army believe it was real if it raised their morale.  adhemar was protected by a band of crusaders led by [[henry of esch]] to preserve the (albeit suspect) relic.  when kerbogha was defeated, adhemar organized a council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes, but he died on 1 august 1098,{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} probably of [[typhus]]. the disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved and the march to [[jerusalem]] was delayed for months. however, the lower-class soldiers continued to think of adhemar as a leader. some of them claimed to have been visited by his ghost during the [[siege of jerusalem (1099)|siege of jerusalem]] and reported that adhemar instructed them to hold another procession around the walls. this was done and jerusalem was taken by the crusaders in 1099.  ==references== {{reflist}}  ===sources===

competition at the age of 15. he subsequently studied performance on those two instruments as well as voice at the [[royal conservatory of brussels]].<ref name=hubbard-encycl/><ref name="ingham1998"/>

continued to make conventional instruments to bring in money. adolphe's first important invention was an improvement of the [[bass clarinet]] design, which he patented at the age of 24. sax relocated permanently to [[paris]] in 1841 and began working on a new set of instruments which he exhibited there in 1844. these were valved [[bugle (instrument)|bugles]], and although he had not invented the instrument itself, his examples were much more successful than those of his rivals and became known as [[saxhorn]]s. they came in seven different sizes, and paved the way for the creation of the [[flugelhorn]]. today, saxhorns are sometimes used in [[concert band]]s and [[orchestra]]s. the saxhorn also laid the groundwork for the modern [[euphonium]].  sax also developed the ''[[saxotromba]]'' family, valved brass instruments with narrower bore than the saxhorns, in 1845, though they survived only briefly.<ref name=hubbard-encycl>{{cite book | last = hubbard |first = w.

largely unchanged today. the advances made by adolphe sax were soon followed by the [[brass band (british style)|british brass band]] movement which exclusively adopted the saxhorn family of instruments. the jedforest instrumental band formed in 1854 and the hawick saxhorn band formed in 1855, within the [[scottish borders]], a decade after saxhorn models became available.  the period around 1840 saw sax inventing the ''clarinette-bourdon'', an early unsuccessful design of [[contrabass clarinet]]. around this time he also developed the instrument for which he is best known: the [[saxophone]] which he patented on 28 june 1846. the saxophone was invented for use in both orchestras and military bands. by 1846 sax had designed (on paper at least) a full range of saxophones (from [[sopranino saxophone|sopranino]] to [[subcontrabass saxophone|subcontrabass]]). composer [[hector berlioz]] wrote approvingly of the new instrument in 1842, but despite his support, saxophones never became standard orchestral instruments. however, their ability to play technical passages easily like [[woodwind instruments |woodwinds]] and also project loudly like [[brass instruments]] led them to be included in [[military bands]] in france and elsewhere. the saxophone was sax's signature accomplishment and created his reputation more than any other. this helped secure him a job teaching at the [[paris conservatory]] in 1857.<ref name=hemke>[[frederick hemke|fred l. hemke]], ''the early history of the saxophone'', ([[doctor of musical arts]] (dma) dissertation), university of wisconsin,

again in 1873.  sax suffered from lip cancer between 1853 and 1858 but made a full recovery. in 1894 sax died in complete poverty<ref>{{cite news|title=adolphe sax

system]] used in some [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems (i.e. those deriving from [[roman law]] or the [[napoleonic code]]) where a judge investigates the case.  the adversarial system is the two-sided structure under which [[criminal procedure|criminal trial]] courts operate that pits the prosecution against the defense.  ==history== some writers{{who|date=march 2015}} trace the

system and provides the opportunity for both sides to argue their point of view.  ==basic features== as an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a [[crime|criminal]] adversarial proceeding, they may not be questioned by a prosecutor or judge unless they choose to do so. however, should they decide to testify, they are subject to [[cross-examination]] and could be found guilty of [[perjury]]. as the election to maintain an accused person's [[right to silence]] prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth. certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.  by contrast, while [[defendant]]s in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor and not given under oath. this allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition. however, this is mainly because it is not the prosecutor but the judges who question the defendant. the concept of "cross"-examination is entirely due to adversarial structure of the common law.  judges in an adversarial system are impartial in ensuring the fair play of [[due process]], or [[fundamental justice]]. such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. at worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision, rendering obsolete the judicial process in question&mdash;[[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.  the [[rules of evidence]] are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. in a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.  all evidence must be relevant and not [[hearsay]] evidence.  peter murphy in his ''practical guide to evidence'' recounts an instructive example. a frustrated judge in an english (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'am i never to hear the truth?' 'no, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.  the name "adversarial system" may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. this is not the case, and both modern adversarial and inquisitorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. indeed, the [[european convention on human rights|european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms]] in article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.  the [[right to counsel]] in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. it was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. as a consequence, it was only in 1836 that england gave suspects of felonies the formal right to have legal counsel (the [[prisoners' counsel act 1836]]), although in practise english courts routinely allowed defendants to be represented by counsel from the mid-18th century. during the second half of the 18th century advocates like [[william garrow|sir william garrow]] and [[thomas erskine, 1st baron erskine]] helped usher in the adversarial court system used in most common law countries today. in the united states, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the [[united states constitution|constitution]] and in state cases at least since the end of the [[american civil war|civil war]], although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36 |title=crs/lii annotated constitution sixth amendment |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref> it was not until 1963 that the [[supreme court of the united states|u.s. supreme court]] declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal sixth amendment, in state courts. see ''[[gideon v. wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}.  one of the most significant differences between the adversarial system and the inquisitorial system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. in an adversarial system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocution]] of her or his crime; an obviously false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. by contrast, in an inquisitiorial system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. this allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversarial systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the united states are handled without trial through such plea bargains.  in some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make [[inference]]s on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question. this obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defense. in england the criminal justice and public order act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in england and wales (it was already possible in scotland under the [[rule of criminative circumstances]]). this change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. the criticism reflects the idea that if the accused can be inferred to be guilty by exercising their right to silence, it no longer confers the protection intended by such a right. in the united states, the [[fifth amendment to the united states constitution|fifth amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.  lord devlin in ''the judge'' said: "it can also be argued that two prejudiced searchers starting from opposite ends of the field will between them be less likely to miss anything than the impartial searcher starting at the middle."<ref>p devlin, ''the judge'' (oxford university press, 1970) 60-1</ref>  ==comparisons with the inquisitorial approach== there are many differences in the way cases are reviewed. it is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show whether or not these systems would come to the same results. however, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.  proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. it also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.  in addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. the common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in the courtroom. most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. the lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges.  proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. they point out that many cases in adversarial systems, and most cases in the united states, are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] or [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. plea bargain as a system does not exist in an inquisitorial system. many legal cases in adversarial systems, and most in the united states, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. in addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not.  ==see also== {{portal|law}} * [[exclusionary rule]] * [[parallel thinking]] - described as a systemic alternative  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== *{{cite book|author=kagan, robert a. |title=adversarial legalism: the american way of law| isbn=9780674012417|date=september 2003|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674012417|publisher=harvard university press|location=cambridge, ma}}  {{criminal procedure}}  {{defaultsort:adversarial system}} [[category:judiciaries]] [[category:legal systems]]Aeclanum | {{redirect|eclano|modern and nearby town|mirabella eclano}} {{infobox ancient site   |name = aeclanum   |native_name = eclano   |alternate_name =    |image = aeclanum (thermae-01).jpg   |alt =    |caption = view of the ''[[thermae]]'' with the ''[[opus reticulatum]]'' brickwork   |map_type = italy   |map_alt =    |coordinates = {{coord|41|3|14|n|15|0|40|e|display=inline,title}}   |location = [[mirabella eclano]] ([[province of avellino]], [[italy]])   |region = [[campania]]   |type = settlement   |part_of =    |length =    |width =    |area =    |height =    |builder =    |material =    |built =    |abandoned =    |epochs = [[roman republic]] - [[byzantine empire]]   |cultures = [[samnites]] - [[ancient rome]]   |dependency_of =    |occupants =    |event =    |excavations =    |archaeologists =    |condition =    |ownership =    |management = soprintendenza per i beni archeologici di salerno, avellino, benevento e caserta   |public_access = yes   |website = [http://www.cir.campania.beniculturali.it/luoghi-della-cultura/parco-archeologico-dellantica-aeclanum aeclanum]   |notes =  }} '''aeclanum''' (also spelled '''aeculanum''', {{lang-it|eclano}}, {{lang-gr|αικούλανον}})<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/eclano_%28enciclopedia_dell%27_arte_antica%29/ aeclanun] on the ''[[treccani|italian encyclopedia treccani]]''</ref> was an ancient town of [[samnium]], southern [[italy]], c. 25&nbsp;km east-southeast of [[benevento|beneventum]], on the [[via appia]]. it lies in [[passo di mirabella]], near the modern [[mirabella eclano]].  == location == [[file:aeclanum (ruins-03).jpg|thumb|left|200px|view of the town]] aeclanum was on a promontory naturally defended, to some extent, by a steep slope on the south side down to the river calore, while the north side lay open towards the crest of the ridge that carried what under the [[roman empire]] became the [[via appia]]. this led through [[ampsanctus|lacus ampsanctus]] to [[aquilonia, italy|aquilonia]] and [[venusia]]. another route to [[apulia]], the via aurelia aeclanensis diverged here, leading through modern [[ariano]] to [[herdoniae]]. the road from aeclanum to [[abellinum]] (mod.

the other two were "curule aediles" (latin ''aediles curules''), open to both plebeians and patricians, in alternating years. an ''aedilis curulis'' was classified as a ''magister curulis''.  the office of the aedilis was generally held by young men intending to follow the [[cursus honorum]] to high political office, traditionally after their [[quaestor]]ship but before their [[praetor]]ship. it was not a compulsory part of the cursus, and hence a former quaestor could be elected to the praetorship without having held the position of aedile. however, it was an advantageous position to hold because it demonstrated the aspiring politician's commitment to public service, as well as giving him the opportunity to hold public festivals and games, an excellent way to increase his name recognition and popularity.  ==history of the office== ===plebeian aediles=== the plebeian aediles were created in the same year as the [[tribune|tribunes of the people]] (494 bc). originally intended as assistants to the tribunes, they guarded the rights of the plebs with respect to their headquarters, the temple of ceres.  subsequently, they assumed responsibility for maintenance of the city's buildings as a whole.<ref>mccullough, 938</ref>  their duties at first were simply ministerial. they were the assistants to the tribunes in whatever matters that the tribunes might entrust to them, although most matters with which they were entrusted were of minimal importance. around 446 bc, they were given the authority to care for the decrees of the senate (''senatus consulta''). when a ''senatus consultum'' was passed, it would be transcribed into a document, and deposited in the public treasury, the ''[[aerarium]]''. they were given this power because the [[roman consul|roman consuls]], who had held this power before, arbitrarily suppressed and altered the documents.<ref name="liv. iii.55">liv. iii.55</ref> they also maintained the acts of the [[plebeian council]] (popular assembly), the "plebiscites". plebiscites, once passed, were also transcribed into a physical document for storage. while their powers grew over time, it is not always easy to distinguish the difference between their powers, and those of the [[roman censor|roman censors]]. occasionally, if a censor was unable to carry out one of his tasks, an aedile would perform the task instead.  ===curule aediles=== according to [[livy]] (vi. 42), after the passing of the [[lex licinia sextia|licinian rogations]] in 367 bc, an extra day was added to the roman games; the plebeian aediles refused to bear the additional expense, whereupon the patricians offered to undertake it, on condition that they were admitted to the aedileship. the plebeians accepted the offer, and accordingly two ''curule'' aediles were appointed—at first from the patricians alone, then from patricians and plebeians in turn, lastly, from either—at the [[tribal assembly]] under the presidency of the consul.<ref name="eb1911"/> curule aediles, as formal magistrates, held certain honors that plebeian aediles (who were not technically magistrates), did not hold. besides having the right to sit on a [[curule chair]] (''sella curulis'') and to wear a [[toga|toga praetexta]], the curule aediles also held the power to issue edicts (''jus edicendi''). these edicts often pertained to matters such as the regulation of the public markets, or what we might call "economic regulation".<ref>cic. verr. v.14</ref> [[livy]] suggests, perhaps incorrectly, that both curule as well as plebeian aediles were sacrosanct.<ref name="liv. iii.55"/> although the curule aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian, their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical.<ref name="eb1911"/> within five days after the beginning of their terms, the four aediles (two plebeian, two curule) were required to determine, by lot or by agreement among themselves, what parts of the city each should hold jurisdiction over.<ref>tabul. heracl. ed. mazoch</ref>  ===differences between the two=== there was a distinction between the two sets of aediles when it came to public festivals. some festivals were plebeian in nature, and thus were under the superintendence of plebeian aediles.<ref>liv. xxxi.56</ref> other festivals were supervised exclusively by the curule aediles,<ref>liv. xxxi.50</ref> and it was often with these festivals that the aediles would spend lavishly. this was often done so as to secure the support of voters in future elections. because aediles were not reimbursed for any of their public expenditures, most individuals who sought the office were independently wealthy. since this office was a stepping stone to higher office and the senate, it helped to ensure that only wealthy individuals (mostly landowners) would win election to high office. these extravagant expenditures began shortly after the end of [[second punic war]], and increased as the spoils returned from rome's new eastern conquests. even the decadence of the emperors rarely surpassed that of the aediles under the republic, as could have been seen during [[julius caesar|julius caesar's]] aedileship.<ref>plut. caesar, 5</ref>  ==election to the office== plebeian aediles were elected by the [[plebeian council]] (popular assembly), usually while under the presidency of a [[plebeian tribune]]. curule aediles were elected by the [[tribal assembly]], usually while under the presidency of a [[roman consul]]. since the plebeian aediles were elected by the [[plebeians]] (commoners), rather than by all of the [[spqr|people of rome]] (plebeians as well as members of the [[patrician (ancient rome)|patrician]] aristocracy), they were not technically [[roman magistrate|magistrates]]. before the passage of the ''lex annalis'', individuals could run for the aedileship by the time they turned twenty-seven. after the passage of this law in 180 bc, a higher age was set, probably thirty-five.<ref>liv. xl.44</ref> by the 1st century bc, aediles were elected in july, and took office on the first day in january.  ==powers of the office== [[cicero]] ([[de legibus|legg.]] iii. 3, 7) divides these functions under three heads:  (1) care of the city: the repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of [[sumptuary]] laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions and the registration of [[meretrix|meretrices]].  they also punished those who had too large a share of the [[ager publicus]], or kept too many cattle on the state pastures.  (2) care of provisions: investigation of the quality of the articles supplied and the correctness of weights and measures; the purchase of grain for disposal at a low price in case of necessity.  (3) care of the games:  superintendence and organization of the public games, as well as of those given by themselves and private individuals (e.g. at funerals) at their own expense.  ambitious persons often spent enormous sums in this manner to win the popular favor with a view to official advancement.<ref name="eb1911"/>  ==under the empire== in 44 bc [[julius caesar]] added two plebeian aediles, called ''cereales'', whose special duty was the care of the cereal (grain) supply.  under [[augustus]] the office lost much of its importance, its judicial functions and the care of the games being transferred to the praetor, while its city responsibilities were limited by the appointment of a [[praefectus urbi]].<ref name="eb1911"/> augustus took for himself its powers over various religious duties. by stripping it of its powers over temples, augustus effectively destroyed the office, by taking from it its original function. after this point, few people were willing to hold such a powerless office, and augustus was even known to compel individuals into holding the office. augustus accomplished this by randomly selecting former tribunes and quaestors for the office.<ref>dio cassius lv.24</ref> future emperors would continue to dilute the power of the office by transferring its powers to newly created offices. however, the office did retain some powers over licentiousness and disorder, in particular over the baths and brothels, as well as the registration of prostitutes.<ref>tacitus ''annales'', ii.85</ref> in the 3rd century, it disappeared altogether.<ref name="eb1911"/>  under the empire, roman colonies and cities often had officials with powers similar to those of the republican aediles, although their powers widely varied. it seems as though they were usually chosen annually.<ref>de aedil. col, &c. otto. lips. 1732</ref> today in [[portugal]] the county mayor can still be referred to as 'edil' (e.g. 'o edil de coimbra', meaning 'the mayor of [[coimbra]]'), a way of reference used also in romania for any mayors (ex. 'edil al bucureștiului', meaning 'mayor of bucharest'). in spain (and latin america) the members of municipal councils are called concejales or ediles.  == shakespeare == in his play ''[[coriolanus]]'', [[william shakespeare|shakespeare]] references the aediles. however, they are minor characters, and their chief role is to serve as policemen.<ref> {{cite book |last=shakespeare |first=william |title=the tragedies of william shakespeare |publisher=random house, inc. |isbn=0-679-60129-5 |pages=1266 }}</ref>  ==see also== * [[aetheling]] * [[agoranomi]] * [[constitution of the roman republic]]  ==references== {{reflist|30em|refs= <ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=1 |wstitle=aedile |volume=1 |page=244}} this cites: * schubert, ''de romanorum aedilibus'' (1828) * hoffmann, ''de aedilibus romanis'' (1842) * göll, ''de aedilibus sub caesarum imperio'' (1860) * labatut, ''les édiles et les moeurs'' (1868) * [[joachim marquardt|marquardt]]-[[theodor mommsen|mommsen]], ''handbuch der römischen altertümer'', ii.

{{update-eb|section=y|date=september 2016}}  more specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  affection is compared with passion, from the greek "[[pathos]]". as such it appears in the writings of [[france|french]] philosopher [[rené descartes]], [[netherlands|dutch]] philosopher [[baruch spinoza]], and most of the writings of early british ethicists.  however, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.  in this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligation.  for a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary, see [[henry sidgwick|h. sidgwick]], ''methods of ethics'' pp.&nbsp;345–349.<ref name="eb1911"/>  ==expression==  {{further information|public display of affection}} affection can be

[[oath|sworn statement of fact]] voluntarily made by an ''affiant'' or ''deponent'' under an oath or affirmation administered by a person authorized to do so by law. such statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiant's [[signature]] by a taker of oaths, such as a [[notary public]] or commissioner of oaths. the name is [[medieval latin]] for ''he/she has declared upon oath''. an affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing, or in other words, it contains a verification, meaning it is under oath or penalty of perjury, and this serves as evidence to its veracity and is required for court proceedings. it is done with the help of court, with a stamp paper. affidavits may be written in the first or third person, depending on who drafted the document. if in the first person, the document's component parts are typically as follows: * a ''commencement'' which identifies the "affiant of truth",<ref>[http://www.duhaime.org/legaldictionary/a/affiant.aspx legal dictionary] retrieved on 11 october 2012</ref> generally stating that everything in it is true, under penalty of perjury, fine, or imprisonment * an ''attestation'' clause, usually a [[jurat (clause)|jurat]], at the end certifying the affiant made oath and the date * signatures of the author and witness  if an affidavit is notarized or authenticated, it will also include a caption with a venue and title in reference to judicial proceedings. in some cases, an introductory clause, called a ''preamble'', is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority.  ==australia== on 2 march 2016, the high court of australia held that the act uniform evidence legislation is neutral in the way sworn evidence and unsworn evidence is treated as being of equal weight.<ref>{{cite web|title=the queen v gw [2016] hca 6|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/hca/2016/6.html|accessdate=6 march 2016}}</ref>  ==india== in indian law, although an affidavit may be taken as proof of the facts stated therein, the courts have no jurisdiction to admit evidence by way of affidavit. affidavit is treated as "evidence" within the meaning of section 3

2013}}</ref> however, it was held by the supreme court that an affidavit can be used as evidence only if the court so orders for sufficient reasons, namely, the right of the opposite party to have the deponent produced for cross-examination (khandesh spg & wvg mills co. ltd. vs rashtriya girni kamgar sangh, citation 1960 air571, 1960 scr(2) 841).  therefore, an affidavit cannot ordinarily be used as evidence in absence of a specific order of the court.  ==ireland== affidavits are made in a similar way as to england and wales, although "make oath" is sometimes omitted. a declaration may be substituted for an affidavit in most cases for those opposed to swearing oaths. the person making the affidavit is known as the deponent but does not sign the affidavit. the affidavit concludes in the standard format "sworn (declared) before me, [name of commissioner for oaths/solicitor], a commissioner for oaths (solicitor), on the [date] at [location] in the county/city of [county/city], and i know the deponent (declarant)", and it is signed and stamped by the commissioner for oaths.  ==united states== in american [[jurisprudence]], under the rules for [[hearsay in united states law|hearsay]], admission of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual (especially if the affiant is not available for [[cross-examination]]) with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar. affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated, or who cannot be located or made to appear, may be accepted by the court, but usually only in the presence of [[corroborating evidence]]. an affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witness's recollection. materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence. if the affiant is a party in the case, the affiant's opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence, as statements by a party-opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule.  affidavits are typically included in the response to [[interrogatories]].<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_33

evidence, in support of the need for the motion. in such a case, a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion, as certain assumptions are made, to wit: the affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes [[judicial economy]]. the lawyer is an [[officer of the court]] and knows that a false swearing by him, if found out, could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including [[disbarment]]. the lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit.    the acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions. equally, the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court (for swearing the affidavit) is not a given. this matter is addressed by the use of the apostille, a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the [[apostille convention|1961 hague

[[morphological derivation|derivational]], like english ''-ness'' and ''pre-'', or [[inflection]]al, like english plural ''-s'' and past tense ''-ed''. they are [[bound morpheme]]s by definition; [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es may be [[separable affix]]es. affixations, the linguistic process speakers use form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.  ==positional categories of affixes== affixes are divided into many categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. ''prefix'' and ''suffix'' are extremely common terms. ''infix'' and ''circumfix'' are less so, as they are not important in european languages. the other terms are uncommon.  {| class="wikitable" |+ categories of affixes ! affix !! example !! schema !! description |- | '''[[prefix]]''' || <span style="color:#009900;">un</span>-do || <span style="color:#009900;">prefix</span>-stem || appears before the stem |- | '''[[suffix]]/postfix''' || look-<span style="color:#009900;">ing</span> || stem-<span style="color:#009900;">suffix</span> || appears after the stem |- | '''suffixoid'''<ref>kremer, marion. 1997.

(the '''niʔ''' here is an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)  in sentence (2), <span style="color:#009900">"baby"</span> does not appear as a free noun. instead it appears as the lexical suffix <span style="color:#009900">'''-əyəł'''</span> which is affixed to the verb root '''šk’ʷ-''' (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" ([[definiteness|definite]]) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.  ==orthographic affixes== in [[orthography]], the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. for example, [[maya script|maya glyphs]] are generally compounds of a ''main sign'' and smaller ''affixes'' joined at its margins. these are called ''prefixes, superfixes, postfixes,'' and ''subfixes'' according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. a small glyph placed inside another is called an ''infix.''<ref>robert sharer & loa traxler, 2006, ''the ancient maya,'' stanford university press. {{isbn|0-8047-4817-9}}</ref> similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the [[indic alphabets]]. for example, the [[tibetan alphabet]] utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.<ref>[[andrew west (linguist)|andrew west]], [http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/09/precomposed-tibetan-part-1-brdarten.html "precomposed tibetan part 1 : brdarten"] ''babelstone,'' september 14, 2006</ref>  ==see also== {{div col|3}} * [[agglutination]] * [[augmentative]] * [[binary prefix]] * [[clitic]] * [[combining form]] * [[concatenation]] * [[diminutive]] * [[english prefixes]] * [[family name affixes]] * [[internet-related prefixes]] * [[marker (linguistics)]] * [[morphological derivation]] * [[separable affix]] * [[si prefix]] * [[stemming]] - affix removal using computer software * [[unpaired word]] * [[word formation]] {{div col end}}  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==bibliography== * {{cite journal|last=gerdts|first=donna b.|year=2003|title=the morphosyntax of halkomelem lexical suffixes|journal=international journal of american linguistics|volume=69|issue=4|pages=345–356|doi=10.1086/382736}} * [[timothy montler|montler, timothy]].

was to enable people to write all the [[african languages]] for practical and scientific purposes without the need of [[diacritic]]s. it is based on the [[international phonetic alphabet]] with a few differences, such as ''j'' and ''y'', which instead have the same (consonant) sound values as in english.  this alphabet has influenced development of orthographies of many african languages (serving

361–289 bc) was a [[greeks|greek]] [[tyrant]] of [[syracuse, sicily|syracuse]] (317–289 bc) and king of [[sicily]] (304–289 bc).  ==biography== agathocles was born at thermae [[himera]]eae (modern name [[termini imerese]]) in sicily. the son of a [[pottery|potter]] who had moved to syracuse in about 343 bc, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army along with his brother [[antander]]. in 333 bc he married the [[widow]] of his patron damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen. he was twice [[exile|banished]] for attempting to overthrow the [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] party in syracuse.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  in 317 bc he returned with an army of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] under a solemn oath to observe the [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitution]] which was established after they took the city. having banished or murdered some 10,000 citizens, and thus made himself master of syracuse, he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of sicily.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  war with [[carthage]] followed. in 311 bc agathocles was defeated in the [[battle of the himera river (311 bc)|battle of the himera river]] and [[siege|besieged]] in syracuse. in 310 bc he made a desperate effort to break through the [[blockade]] and attack the enemy in [[africa]]. in africa he concluded the treaty with [[ophellas]], ruler of [[cyrenaica]]. after several victories he was at last completely defeated (307 bc) and fled secretly to sicily.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  after concluding peace with carthage in 306 bc, agathocles styled himself king of sicily in 304 bc, and established his rule over the [[greece|greek]] cities of the island more firmly than ever. a peace treaty with carthage left him in control of sicily east of the [[halycus|halycus river]]. even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on carthage at the time of his death.  his last years were plagued by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson [[archagathus (grandson of agathocles of syracuse)|archagathus]], at whose instigation he is said to have been [[poison]]ed; according to others, he died a natural death. he was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular "tyrant." agathocles restored the syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.  agathocles was married three times. his first wife was the widow of his patron damas by whom he had two sons: [[archagathus (son of agathocles of syracuse)|archagathus]] and agathocles, who were both murdered in 307 bc. his second wife was alcia and they had a daughter called [[lanassa (wife of pyrrhus)|lanassa]], who married as the second wife of king [[pyrrhus of epirus]]. his third wife was the [[ptolemaic dynasty|greek ptolemaic princess]] [[theoxena of syracuse|theoxena]], who was the second daughter of [[berenice i of egypt|berenice i]] from her first husband [[philip (first husband of berenice i of egypt)|philip]] and was a stepdaughter of [[ptolemy i soter]]. theoxena bore agathocles two children: [[archagathus of libya|archagathus]] and [[theoxena of egypt|theoxena]]. theoxena survived agathocles. he had further descendants from his second and third marriage.  ==legacy== agathocles was cited as an example "of those who by their crimes come to be princes” in chapter viii of [[niccolò machiavelli]]’s treatise on politics -  ''[[the prince]]'' (1513).  he was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career. machiavelli claimed: {{quote|it cannot be called prowess to kill fellow-citizens, to betray friends, to be treacherous, pitiless, irreligious. ... still, if the courage of agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickednesses do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.<ref>''the prince'', chapter viii</ref>}}  machiavelli goes on to reason that agathocles' success, in contrast to other criminal tyrants, was due to his ability to mitigate his crimes by limiting them to those that  {{quote|are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects.}} however, he came to "glory" as much as he did brutality by repelling invading carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land.  ==notes== {{reflist}}  ==references== * {{eb1911|wstitle=agathocles|volume=1|page=370}} * [http://www.third-millennium-library.com/readinghall/galleryofhistory/agathocles/door.html the history of agathocles by h. j. w. tillyard (btm format)] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20110912031818/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0269.html ancient library articles: archagathus no. 1 & 2] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20111126033401/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/theoxena.htm ptolemaic genealogy: theoxena] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100716/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/egypt/ptolemies/affilates/aff_ptolemies.htm ptolemy dynasty: affiliated lines – agathocles] * schubert, (1887) ''geschichte des agathokles'' * grote, ''history of greece'', ch. 97.  ==primary sources== <!-- * [[junianus justinus|justin]] [specific citation needed] --> * [[diodorus siculus]] xix., xxi., xxii.

erlang''' (1 january 1878 – 3 february 1929) was a [[denmark|danish]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[engineer]], who invented the fields of [[teletraffic engineering|traffic engineering]] and [[queueing theory]].  by the time of his relatively early death at the age of 51, erlang had created the field of [[pstn|telephone networks]] analysis. his early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the [[erlang formula]], which became a foundational element of present-day [[telecommunication]] network studies.  == life ==  erlang was born at lønborg, near [[tarm]], in [[jutland]].  he was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of [[thomas fincke]] on his mother's side.  at age 14, he passed the preliminary examination of the [[university of copenhagen]] with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age.  for the next two years he taught alongside his father.  a distant relative provided free board and lodging, and erlang prepared for and took the university of [[copenhagen]] entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction.  he won a scholarship to the university and majored in [[mathematics]], and also studied [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].  he graduated in 1901 with an ma and over the next 7 years taught at several schools. he maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the university of copenhagen.  he was a member of the danish mathematicians' association (tbmi) and through this met amateur mathematician [[johan jensen (mathematician)|johan jensen]], the chief engineer of the [[copenhagen telephone company]] (ktas in danish), an [[corporate spin-off|offshoot]] of the [[international bell telephone company]].  erlang worked for the ctc (ktas) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in copenhagen after an abdominal operation.  he was an associate of the british [[institution of electrical engineers]].  == contributions ==  while working for the ctc, erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service.  his thinking went further by finding how many [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]] were needed to handle a given volume of calls.  most [[telephone exchange]]s then used human operators and [[telephone switchboard|cord boards]] to switch [[telephone call]]s by means of jack plugs.  out of necessity, erlang was a hands-on researcher.  he would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street [[manhole]]s to do so. <!-- he famously said that this was a "no brainer."{{citation needed|date=april 2008}} the actual quote in danish w/translation would be desired. --> he was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly [[logarithm]]s.  he devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.  he developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years.  his significant publications include: * in 1909 - "the theory of probabilities and telephone conversations" - which proves that the [[poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic. * in 1917 - "solution of some problems in the theory of probabilities of significance in automatic telephone exchanges" - which contains his classic formulae for [[grade of service#erlang's lost call assumptions|call loss]] and waiting time.  these and other notable papers were translated into english, french and german.  his papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field.  one researcher from [[bell telephone laboratories]] is said to have learned danish to study them.  the [[bt group plc|british post office]] accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities.  in 1946, the [[ccitt]] named the international unit of telephone traffic "the [[erlang (unit)|erlang]]".<ref>{{mactutor

[[annibale carracci|annibale]] and cousin of [[lodovico carracci]].  he posited the ideal in nature, and was the founder of the competing school to the more gritty view of nature as expressed by [[michelangelo merisi|caravaggio]]. he was one of the founders of the [[accademia degli incamminati]] along with his brother, annibale carracci, and cousin, ludovico carracci. the academy helped propel painters of the [[bolognese school (painting)|school of bologna]] to prominence.  ==life== agostino carracci was born in [[bologna]], and trained at the workshop of the architect domenico tibaldi. starting from 1574 he worked as a reproductive [[engraver]], copying works of 16th century masters such as [[federico barocci]], [[tintoretto]], [[antonio campi]], [[paolo veronese|veronese]] and [[correggio]]. he also produced some original prints, including two [[etching]]s.  he travelled to [[venice]] (1582, 1587–1589) and [[parma]] (1586–1587). together with annibale and ludovico he worked in bologna on the fresco cycles in [[palazzo fava]] (''histories of jason and medea'', 1584) and [[palazzo magnani, bologna|palazzo magnani]] (''histories of [[romulus]]'', 1590–1592). in 1592

was born in [[nagoya|nagoya, aichi]], japan. morita's family was involved in [[sake]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]] production in the village of kosugaya (currently a part of [[tokoname, aichi|tokoname city]]) on the western coast of [[chita peninsula]] in [[aichi prefecture]] since 1665. he was the oldest of four siblings and his father kyuzaemon trained him as a child to take over the family business. akio, however, found his true calling in mathematics and physics, and in 1944 he graduated from [[osaka university|osaka imperial university]] with a degree in physics. he was later commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the [[imperial japanese navy]], and served in [[world war ii]]. during his service, morita met his future business partner masaru ibuka in the navy's wartime research committee.  ==sony== on may 7, 1946, ibuka founded<ref>https://www.sony.net/sonyinfo/news/press_archive/199801/ibuka-e.html</ref> ''tokyo tsushin kogyo kabushiki kaisha'' (tokyo telecommunications engineering corporation, the forerunner of sony corporation) with about 20 employees and initial capital of ¥190,000. ibuka was 38 years old. morita, 25 years old joined ''tokyo tsushin kogyo kabushiki kaisha'' shortly after its inception, with morita's family investing in sony during the early period and being the largest shareholder.  in 1949, the company developed magnetic recording tape and in 1950, sold the first [[tape recorder]] in japan. in 1957, it produced a pocket-sized radio (the first to be fully [[transistor]]ized), and in 1958, morita and ibuka decided to rename their company sony (derived from "sonus"--[[latin]] for "sound"—and ''sonny-boys'' the most common american expression).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/akio_morita |title=akio morita |work=ieee global history network |publisher=ieee |accessdate=july 21, 2011}}</ref> morita was an advocate for all the products made by [[sony]]. however, since the radio was slightly too big to fit in a shirt pocket, morita made his employees wear shirts with slightly larger pockets to give the radio a "pocket sized" appearance. in 1960, it produced the first [[transistor]] television in the world. in 1973, sony received an [[emmy award]] for its [[trinitron]] television-set technology. in 1975, it released the first [[betamax]] home video recorder, a year before [[vhs]] format came out. in 1979, the [[walkman]] was introduced, making it one of the world's first portable music players. in 1984, sony launched the [[discman]] series which extended their walkman brand to portable cd products.  in 1960, the sony corporation of america (sonam, currently abbreviated as sca) was established in the united states. in 1961, sony corporation was the first japanese company to be listed on the [[new york stock exchange]], in the form of [[american depositary receipt]]s (adrs), which are traded over-the-counter. sony bought cbs records group<ref>{{cite

entertainment ([[columbia pictures]], [[tristar pictures]] and others) in 1989.  on november 25, 1994, morita stepped down as sony chairman after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while playing tennis. he was succeeded by [[norio ohga]], who had joined the company in the 1950s after sending morita a letter denouncing the poor quality of the company's tape recorders.  ==other affiliations== morita was vice chairman of the [[japan business federation]] ([[japan federation of economic organizations]]), and was a member of the japan-u.s. economic relations group, also known as the "wise men's group". he was also the third japanese chairman of the [[trilateral commission]]. his amateur radio call sign is jp1dpj.  ==publications== in 1966, morita wrote a book called ''gakureki muyō ron'' (学歴無用論, never mind school records), where he stresses that school records are not important to success or one's business skills. in 1986, morita wrote an autobiography titled ''[[made in japan (biography)|made in japan]]''. he co-authored the 1991 book ''[[the japan that can say no]]'' with politician [[shintaro ishihara]], where they criticized american business practices and encouraged japanese to take a more independent role in business and foreign affairs. the book was translated into english and caused controversy in the united states, and morita later had his chapters removed from the english version and distanced himself from the book.<ref>city mayors [http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/tokyo_mayor.html shintaro ishihara governor of tokyo 7 september 2012] retrieved on september 22, 2012</ref>  ==awards== morita was awarded the [[albert medal (royal society of arts)|albert medal]] by the united kingdom's [[royal society of arts]] in 1982, the first japanese to receive the honor. two years later, he received the prestigious [[legion of honour]], and in 1991, was awarded the first class [[order of the sacred treasure]] from the [[akihito|emperor of japan]]. in 1993, he was awarded an honorary [[order of the british empire|british knighthood (kbe)]]. morita received the international distinguished entrepreneur award from the [[university of manitoba]] in 1987. he was posthumously awarded the grand cordon of the [[order of the rising sun]] in 1999.  ==death== morita suffered a stroke in 1993, during a game of tennis. on november 25, 1994, he stepped down as sony chairman. on october 3, 1999, morita died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 78.  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== *morita, akio.

highly variable as well; extended cold snaps of forty below zero can be followed by unseasonable warmth with temperatures above freezing due to [[chinook wind]] effects.  summers can be warm and dry for extended periods creating ideal fire weather conditions. weak thunderstorms produce mostly dry lightning, sparking wildfires that are mostly left to burn themselves out as they are often far from populated areas. the [[2004 alaska fire season|2004 season]] set a new record with over {{convert|6600000|acre|km2}} burned. [[file:lakesalaskarange.jpg|thumb|left|lakes and peaks of the alaska range seen from the [[denali highway]]]] the average annual precipitation in fairbanks is 11.3&nbsp;inches (28.7&nbsp;cm).  most of this comes in the form of snow during the winter.  most storms in the interior of alaska originate in the [[gulf of alaska]], south of the state, though these storms often have limited precipitation due to a [[rain shadow]] effect caused by the [[alaska range]].  on clear winter nights, the [[aurora borealis]] can often be seen dancing in the sky.  like all subarctic regions, the months from may to july in the summer have no night, only a twilight during the night hours. the months of november to january have little daylight.  fairbanks receives an average 21 hours of daylight between may 10 and august 2 each summer, and an average of less than four hours of daylight between november 18 and january 24 each winter.  the interior of alaska is largely underlined by discontinuous [[permafrost]], which grades to continuous permafrost as the [[arctic circle]] is approached.  <gallery class="center"  caption="summer 2009 fires (outlined in red)"> image:fires in interior

bayreuth|brandenburg-kulmbach]] (brandenburg-bayreuth) from 1527 to 1553. he was a member of the [[franconia]]n branch of the [[house of hohenzollern]]. because of his bellicose nature, albert during his lifetime was given the cognomen ''bellator'' ("the warlike").  posthumously, he became known as    ''[[alcibiades]]''.  ==biography== albert was born in [[ansbach]] and, having lost his father [[casimir, margrave of brandenburg-bayreuth|casimir]] in 1527, he came under the guardianship of his uncle [[george, margrave of brandenburg-ansbach]], a strong adherent of [[protestantism]]. in 1541, he received [[bayreuth]] as his share of the family lands, but, as the chief town of his principality was [[kulmbach]], he is sometimes referred to as the margrave of brandenburg-kulmbach. his restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career; and having collected a small band of soldiers, he assisted emperor [[charles v, holy roman emperor|charles v]] in his [[italian war of 1542–1546|war with france]] in 1543.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  the [[peace of crépy]] in september 1544 deprived him of this employment, but he had won a considerable reputation, and when charles was preparing to attack the [[schmalkaldic league]], he took pains to win albert's assistance.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  sharing in the attack on the [[electorate of saxony]], albert was taken prisoner at [[rochlitz]] in march 1547 by elector [[john frederick, elector of saxony|john frederick]] of saxony, but was released as a result of the emperor's victory at the [[battle of mühlberg]] in the succeeding april.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  he then followed the fortunes of his friend elector [[maurice, elector of saxony|maurice]] of saxony, deserted charles, and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the emperor by an alliance with king [[henry ii of france]].{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  he took part in the subsequent campaign, but when the [[peace of passau]] was signed in august 1552 he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in [[franconia]],{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} which led to the [[second margrave war]].  having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of [[nuremberg]], he quarrelled with his supporter, the french king, and offered his services to the emperor.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} charles, anxious to secure such a famous fighter, gladly assented to albert's demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of [[bishopric of würzburg|würzburg]] and [[bishopric of bamberg|bamberg]]; and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the emperor on the retreat from the [[siege of metz (1552)|siege of metz]] in january 1553.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  when charles left germany a few weeks later, albert renewed his depredations in franconia.  these soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him, and maurice of saxony led an army against his former comrade.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} the rival forces met at [[battle of sievershausen|sievershausen]] on 9 july 1553, and after a combat of unusual ferocity albert was put to flight. [[henry v, duke of brunswick-lüneburg|henry, duke of brunswick-wolfenbüttel]], then took command of the troops of the league, and after albert had been placed under the imperial ban in december 1553 he was defeated by duke henry, and compelled to flee to france.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} he there entered the service of henry ii of france and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at [[pforzheim]] on 8 january 1557.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  he is defined by [[thomas carlyle]] as "a failure of a [[fritz]]," with "features" of a [[frederick ii of prussia|frederick the great]] in him, "but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent". he had early two children: [[friedrich of brandenburg-bayreuth|frederick]] and [[anna of brandenburg-bayreuth|anna]]. he was to be buried heilsbronn münster.  ==ancestors== {{unreferenced section|date=february 2014}} {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} <center>{{ahnentafel-compact4 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; |1= 1.

only been moved from [[acharnes]] and re-sited in the agora in [[augustus]]'s time, and statues known to derive from alcamenes' statue show the god in a [[breastplate]],<ref>one sculpture of ares and

represented in an [[neo-attic]], archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of alcamenes, who was almost certainly a

but, in accordance with edgar's instructions, their brother [[david i of scotland|david]] was granted an [[appanage]] in southern scotland. edgar's will granted david the lands of the former [[kingdom of strathclyde]] or cumbria, and this was apparently agreed in advance by edgar, alexander, david and their brother-in-law [[henry i of england]]. in 1113, perhaps at henry's instigation, and with the support of his [[anglo-norman]] allies, david demanded, and received, additional lands in [[lothian]] along the upper [[river tweed|tweed]] and [[river teviot|teviot]]. david did not receive the title of king, but of "prince of the cumbrians", and his lands remained under alexander's final authority.<ref>oram, pp. 60–63.</ref>  the dispute over tweeddale and teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between alexander and david, although it was unpopular in some quarters. a [[scottish gaelic language|gaelic]] poem laments:<blockquote>it's bad what malcolm's son has done,<br>dividing us from alexander;<br>he causes, like each king's son before,<br>the plunder of stable alba.<ref>oram, p. 66 citing [[thomas owen clancy|clancy]], ''the triumph tree''.</ref></blockquote>  the dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between alexander and henry of england. in 1114 he joined henry on campaign in wales against [[gruffudd ap cynan]] of [[kingdom of gwynedd|gwynedd]].<ref>oram, p. 65.</ref> alexander's marriage with henry's illegitimate daughter [[sybilla of normandy]] may have occurred as early as 1107, or as at late as 1114.<ref>oram, p. 65; a date around 1114 would place the marriage at about the same time as that of david and [[maud, 2nd countess of huntingdon|maud of huntingdon]].</ref>  [[william of malmesbury]]'s account attacks sybilla, but the evidence argues that alexander and sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and sybilla was of noteworthy piety.<ref>duncan, p. 65; oram, p. 71.</ref> sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at ''eilean nam ban'' ([[kenmore, perth and kinross|kenmore]] on [[loch tay]]) in july 1122 and was buried at [[dunfermline abbey]]. alexander did not remarry and [[walter bower]] wrote that he planned an [[augustinian]] [[priory]] at the ''eilean nam ban'' dedicated to sybilla's memory, and he may have taken steps to have her [[veneration|venerated]].<ref>oram, p. 71.</ref> [[file:alexander i (alba) ii.jpg|thumb|250px|the reverse of the [[seal (device)|seal]] of alexander i, enhanced as a 19th-century steel engraving.]] alexander had at least one illegitimate child, [[máel coluim mac alaxandair]], who was later to be involved in a revolt against [[david i of scotland|david i]] in the 1130s. he was imprisoned at [[roxburgh]] for many years afterwards, perhaps until his death some time after 1157.<ref>oram, p. 77. the identity of this person may be still in question, see [[meic uilleim]] and [[macheths]].</ref>  alexander was, like his brothers edgar and david, a notably pious king. he was responsible for foundations at [[scone, perthshire|scone]] and [[inchcolm]]. his mother's chaplain and [[hagiography|hagiographer]] [[thurgot]] was named [[bishop of saint andrews]] (or ''cell rígmonaid'') in 1107, presumably by alexander's order.<ref name = "ystlxt"/> the case of thurgot's would-be successor [[eadmer]] shows that alexander's wishes were not always accepted by the religious community, perhaps because eadmer had the backing of the [[archbishop of canterbury]], [[ralph d'escures]], rather than [[thurstan]] of [[archbishop of york|york]]. alexander also patronised [[saint andrews]], granting lands intended for an augustinian priory, which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife.<ref>barrow, p. 156.</ref>  for all his religiosity, alexander was not remembered as a man of peace. [[john of fordun]] says of him: {{quote|now the king was a lettered and godly man; very humble and amiable towards the clerics and regulars, but terrible beyond measure to the rest of his subjects; a man of large heart, exerting himself in all things beyond his strength.<ref>fordun, v, xxviii ([[william forbes skene|skene's]] edition).</ref>}}  he manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the [[mormaerdom of moray]].

[[file:coat of arms of alexander jagiellonczyk.svg|thumb|left|200px|coat of arms of alexander i jagiellon]]  during his reign, poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality, [[moldavia]]. only the death of [[stephen iii of moldavia|stephen]], the great ''[[hospodar]]'' of moldavia, enabled poland still to hold her own on the [[danube river]]; while the liberality of [[pope julius ii]], who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of poland and granted alexander [[peter's pence]] and other financial help, enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the teutonic order.  alexander jagellon never felt at home in poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow lithuanians, the most notable of whom was the wealthy lithuanian magnate [[michael glinski]], who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the tatars at [[kleck]] (5 august 1506), news of which was brought to alexander on his deathbed in [[vilnius]].  it is important to note that alexander was the last known ruler of the [[gediminids]] dynasty to have maintained the family's ancestral [[lithuanian language]].{{citation needed|date=april 2010}} from his death, polish became the sole language of the family, thus fully [[polonisation|polonising]] the [[jagiello]] family.  in 1931, during the refurbishment of [[vilnius cathedral]], the forgotten sarcophagus of alexander was discovered, and has since been put on display.  ==gallery== <gallery> file:johann_haller,_commune_incliti_poloniae_regni_privilegium_constitutionum_et_indultuum_publicitus_decretorum_approbatorumque_(1506,_cropped).jpg|king alexander in [[senate of the republic of poland|polish senate]], 1506. file:kanclerz.jpg|alexander and his ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[jan łaski]]. file:vilnius.sv.onos baznycia.saint ann's church2.jpg|[[gothic architecture|gothic]] [[st. anne's church, vilnius|st. anne's church]] in [[vilnius]] was constructed on his initiative in 1495–1500.  file:krakow wawel 20070804 0930.jpg|in 1504 he ordered to rebuild the [[wawel castle|wawel]] in a [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] style.<ref>[http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/index.php?op=4 wawel castle]. history of the royal residence.</ref>  file:alexander of poland.png|portrait by [[bacciarelli]] </gallery>  ==ancestors== {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} <center>{{ahnentafel-compact5 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; |boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe; |1= 1. alexander, king of poland |2= 2.

[[plutarch]] relates that alexander worshiped the spear he slew his uncle with as if it were a god.<ref name="wess"/><ref>[[plutarch]], ''pelop.'' p. 293, &c.</ref>  alexander governed tyrannically, and according to [[diodorus siculus|diodorus]],<ref name="ds"/> differently from the former rulers, but polyphron, at least, seems to have set him the example.<ref name="xh"/>  the states of [[thessaly]], which had previously acknowledged the authority of [[jason of pherae]],<ref name="ds"/> were not so willing to submit to alexander the tyrant, (especially the old family of the [[aleuadae]] of [[larissa]], who had most reason to fear him).  therefore, they applied for help from [[alexander ii of macedon]].  alexander of pherae prepared to meet his enemy in [[macedon]]ia, but the king anticipated him, and, reaching [[larissa]], was admitted into the city.  alexander withdrew to [[pherae]] whilst the macedonian king placed a garrison in larissa, as well as in [[crannon]], which had also come over to him.<ref name="ds"/>  but once the bulk of the macedonian army had retired, the states of thessaly feared the return and vengeance of alexander, and so sent for aid to [[thebes (greece)|thebes]], whose policy it was to put a check on any neighbor who might otherwise become too formidable.  thebes accordingly dispatched [[pelopidas]] to the aid of thessaly.  on arrival of pelopidas at larissa, whence according to diodorus, he dislodged the macedonian garrison, alexander presented himself and offered submission.  when pelopidas expressed indignation at the tales of alexander's profligacy and cruelty, alexander took alarm and fled.<ref>[[diodorus siculus]], xv. 67</ref><ref name="plut">[[plutarch]], ''pelop.'' p. 291-297, d.</ref>  these events appear to refer to the early part of the year 368 bc.  in the summer of that year pelopidas was again sent into [[thessaly]], in consequence of fresh complaints against alexander.  accompanied by [[ismenias]], he went merely as a negotiator, without any military force, and was seized by alexander and thrown into prison.<ref name="plut"/><ref name="ds2">[[diodorus siculus]], xv. 71-75</ref><ref>[[polybius]], viii. 1</ref>  the scholar [[william mitford]] suggested that pelopidas was taken prisoner in battle, but the language of [[demosthenes]] hardly supports such an inference.<ref name="demo">[[demosthenes]], ''against aristocrates'' p. 660</ref><ref>[[william mitford]], ''history of greece'' ch. 27. sec. 5</ref>  the thebans sent a large army into thessaly to rescue pelopidas, but they could not keep the field against the superior cavalry of alexander, who, aided by auxiliaries from [[athens]], pursued them with great slaughter.  the destruction of the whole theban army is said to only have been averted by the ability of [[epaminondas]], who was serving in the campaign, but not as general.  in 367 bc, alexander carried out a massacre of the citizens of [[skotousa]];.<ref name="plut"/><ref name="ds2"/><ref>[[pausanias (geographer)|pausanias]], ''description of greece'' vi. 5</ref>  a fresh theban expedition into [[thessaly]], under [[epaminondas]] resulted, according to [[plutarch]], in a three-year truce and the release of prisoners, including pelopidas.<ref name="plut"/><ref name="ds2"/>  during the next three years, alexander seemed to renew his attempts to subdue the states of thessaly, especially [[magnesia (regional unit)|magnesia]] and [[phthiotis]],<ref name="plut"/> for upon the expiry of the truce, in 364 bc, they again applied to thebes for protection from him.  the theban army under pelopidas is said to have been dismayed by an [[eclipse]] (on july 13, 364, see [[list of solar eclipses in the 4th century bc|4th century bc eclipses]]), and pelopidas, leaving the bulk of his army behind, entered thessaly at the head of three hundred volunteer horsemen and some mercenaries.  at [[battle of cynoscephalae|cynoscephalae]], the thebans defeated alexander, but pelopidas was killed.<ref name="plut"/><ref name="ds3">[[diodorus siculus]], xv. 80</ref>  this was closely followed by another theban victory under malcites and diogiton.  alexander was then forced to restore the conquered towns to the thessalians, confine himself to pherae, join the [[boeotian league]], and become a dependent ally of [[thebes (greece)|thebes]].<ref name="xh"/><ref name="plut"/><ref name="ds3"/>  if the death of [[epaminondas]] in 362 bc freed athens from fear of thebes, it appears at the same time to have exposed it to further aggression from alexander of pherae, who made a [[piracy|piratical]] raid on [[tinos]] and other cities of the [[cyclades]], plundering them, and making slaves of the inhabitants.  he also besieged [[peparethus]], and "even landed troops in attica itself, and seized the port of panormus, a little eastward of [[sounion]]."  the athenian admiral [[leosthenes]] defeated alexander and managed to relieve peparethus, but alexander escaped from being blockaded in panormus, took several attic [[trireme]]s, and plundered the [[piraeus]].<ref name="wess"/><ref>[[diodorus siculus]], xv.

is assigned by [[diodorus siculus|diodorus]] to 357/356 bc.  [[plutarch]] gives a detailed account of it, with a lively picture of the palace.  guards watched throughout the night, except at alexander's bedchamber, which was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door.  thebe, alexander's wife and cousin (or half-sister, as the daughter of [[jason of pherae]]),<ref name="plut"/> concealed her three brothers in the house during the day, had the dog removed when alexander had gone to rest, and, having covered the steps of the ladder with wool, brought up the young men to her husband's chamber.  though she had taken away alexander's sword, they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him.  her brothers then entered and killed alexander.  his body was cast into the streets, and exposed to every indignity.  of thebe's motive for the murder different accounts are given.  [[plutarch]] states it to have been fear of her husband, together with hatred of his cruel and brutal character, and ascribes these feelings principally to the representations of pelopidas, when she visited him in his prison.  in [[cicero]] the deed is ascribed to jealousy.  other accounts have it that alexander had taken thebe's youngest brother as his [[eromenos]] and tied him up.  exasperated by his wife's pleas to release the youth, he murdered the boy, which drove her to revenge. <ref name="plut"/><ref>[[diodorus siculus]], xvi. 14</ref><ref>[[xenophon]], ''[[hellenica]]'' vi. 4. ~ 37</ref><ref>[[cicero]], ''[[de officiis]]'' 7</ref><ref>[[cicero]], ''[[de inventione]]'' ii. 49</ref><ref>aristot.

source|date=february 2012}}  the '''alexandrists''' were a school of [[renaissance]] philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the ''de anima'' given by [[alexander of aphrodisias]].{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  according to the orthodox [[thomism]] of the [[roman catholic church]], [[aristotle]] rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. against this, the averroists, led by [[agostino nifo]], introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  these two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal one.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  the alexandrists, led by [[pietro pomponazzi]], assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to aristotle.  they held that aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  hence the alexandrists denied the aristotle viewed the soul as immortal, because in their view, since they believed that aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  ==references== {{portal|christianity}} {{reflist}}  '''attribution:''' *{{eb1911|wstitle=alexandrists|volume=1|page=576}}  [[category:christian philosophy]]

{{abbr|d.|died}}&nbsp;december 1205) was the [[byzantine emperor]] from 5 february to 12 april 1204 during the [[siege of constantinople (1204)|second and final siege]] of [[constantinople]] by the participants of the [[fourth crusade]]. he was a member of the [[doukas]] family, nicknamed '''mourtzouphlos''' or '''murtzuphlus''' ({{lang|grc|μούρτζουφλος}}), either in reference to bushy, overhanging [[eyebrow]]s or a sullen, gloomy character.  a byzantine nobleman, his participation in the attempted overthrow of [[alexios iii angelos]] by [[john komnenos the fat]] in 1200 had led to his imprisonment until the restoration to the throne of [[isaac ii angelos]]. isaac ii, along with his son [[alexios iv angelos]], were restored to the throne through the intervention of leaders of the fourth crusade in july 1203. released, murtzuphlus was allowed the court position of ''[[protovestiarios]]''. he had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of [[eudokia angelina]], a daughter of emperor [[alexios iii angelos]].  by the beginning of 1204, isaac ii and alexios iv had inspired little confidence among the people of constantinople in their efforts to defend the city from the latins and venetians, who were restless and rioted when the money and aid promised by alexios iv was not forthcoming. alexios doukas emerged as a leader of the anti-latin movement and personally led some skirmishes against the crusaders. when the populace rebelled in late january 1204, the two emperors barricaded themselves in the palace and entrusted alexios doukas with a mission to seek help from the crusaders. instead, alexios doukas used his access to the palace to arrest the emperors. the young alexios iv was strangled in prison, while his father isaac died shortly afterwards, his death variously attributed to fright, sorrow, or foul play. alexios v doukas was crowned in early february 1204.  after his coronation, alexios v began to strengthen the [[walls of constantinople|defenses]] of [[constantinople]] and ended negotiations with the latins. it was too late, however, for the new emperor to make much of a difference. an attempted surprise attack against the crusader camp failed despite the emperor's personal leadership. during the ensuing fight, the defenders of constantinople held out against the crusader counterattack of 9 april. the crusaders' second attack proved too strong to repel, and alexios v fled towards [[thrace]] on the night of 12 april 1204, accompanied by eudokia angelina and her mother [[euphrosyne doukaina kamatera]]. constantinople was under latin control by the next day.  the refugees reached [[mosynopolis]], the base of the deposed emperor alexios iii angelos, where they were initially well received, with alexios v marrying eudokia angelina. later, however, alexios iii arranged for his new son-in-law to be ambushed and blinded, making him ineligible for the imperial throne. abandoned by his supporters and enemies alike, alexios v was captured near mosynopolis by the advancing latins under [[thierry de loos]] in november 1204. brought back to constantinople, alexios v was condemned to death for treason against alexios iv, and was thrown from the top of the [[column of theodosius]]. he was the last byzantine emperor to reign in constantinople before the establishment of the [[latin empire]], which controlled the city for the next 57 years, until it was recovered by the [[empire of nicaea|nicaean emperor]] [[michael viii palaiologos]].  ==see also== {{portal|byzantine empire}} *[[list of

several leading figures of new comedy, such as philippides, [[philemon (poet)|philemon]], [[diphilus]], and even menander. there is also some evidence that, during his old age, he wrote plays in the

june 1291), called '''the liberal''' (''el liberal'') or '''the free''' (also "the frank," from ''el franc''), was the [[king of aragon]] and [[count of barcelona]] (as '''alfons ii''') from 1285. he conquered the [[kingdom of majorca]] between his succession and 1287.  he was a son of king [[peter iii of aragon]] and [[constance of sicily, queen of aragon|constance]], daughter and heiress of king [[manfred of sicily]].  soon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the [[balearic islands]] into the [[kingdom of aragon]] - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather, [[james i of aragon]]. thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle, [[james ii of majorca]], and conquered both majorca  (1285) and ibiza (1286), effectively reassuming suzerainty over the [[kingdom of majorca]]. he followed this with the conquest of [[minorca]] - until then, an autonomous [[muslim]] state ([[manûrqa]]) within the kingdom of majorca - on 17 january 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as minorca's national holiday.  he initially sought to maintain aragonese control over sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to the island of his brother, [[james ii of aragon]]. however, he later retracted the support for his brother shortly before his death and instead tried to make peace with the [[papal states]] france.{{sfn|jones|2000|page=595}}  his reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the [[union of aragon]] - the so-called "magna carta of aragon", which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. his inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the kingdom of aragon close to anarchy.  during his lifetime a dynastic marriage with [[eleanor of england (1269-1298)|eleanor]], daughter of king [[edward i of england]], was arranged. however alfonso died before meeting his bride. he died at the age of 26 in 1291, and was buried in the franciscan convent in barcelona; since 1852 his remains have been buried in barcelona cathedral.  [[dante alighieri]], in [[the divine comedy]], recounts that he saw alfonso's spirit seated outside the gates of [[purgatory]] with the other monarchs whom dante blamed for the chaotic political state of [[europe]] during the 13th century.  ==ancestry== {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} <center>{{ahnentafel-compact5 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; |boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe; |1= 1.

different periods: first in the year 783 and later from 791 until his death in 842. upon his death, nepociano, a family member of undetermined relation, attempted to usurp the crown in place of the future ramiro i.  during his reign, which covered a span of 51 years, alfonso discovered the supposed tomb of [[james, son of zebedee|apostle santiago]] in the town of compostela, which later became known as the city of [[santiago de compostela]].  he was the son of [[fruela i of asturias|fruela i]] and the [[basque people|basque]] munia.  == early life == he was born in [[oviedo]] in 759 or 760. he was put under the guardianship of his aunt [[adosinda]] after his father's death, but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of [[samos]]. he was the governor of the palace during the reign of adosinda's husband [[silo of asturias|silo]]. on silo's death, he was elected king by adosinda's allies, but the magnates raised his uncle [[mauregatus of asturias|mauregatus]] to the throne instead. alfonso fled to [[álava]] where he found shelter with his maternal relatives. mauregatus was succeeded by [[bermudo i of asturias|bermudo]], alfonso's cousin, who abdicated after his defeat at the [[battle of the burbia river]].  == alfonso proclaimed king == alfonso was subsequently elected king on september 14, 791. poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage between his sister ximena and sancho, count of saldana, and the feats of their son [[bernardo del carpio]]. bernardo is the hero of a ''[[cantar de gesta]]'' (''chanson de geste'') written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.<ref>{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=alphonso|display=alphonso s.v. alphonso ii.|volume=1|page=734}}</ref>  == andalusian raids into asturias == on accession to the throne, [[hisham i of córdoba|hisham i]], son of [[abd al-rahman i]], commenced a string of military campaigns in the eastern pyrenees and to the north-west. in 794, a raid spearheaded by abd al-karim dealt a major military blow to alfonso ii on the eastern fringes of the kingdom of asturias (cantabria and castile). the asturian king asked for the assistance of the [[basque people|basque]] frankish vassal belasco, master of [[álava]] and bordering regions at the time. abd al-karim advanced deeper west into asturias and pillaged the region, while his brother abd al-malik ventured into the western asturian lands.  == relations with charlemagne and the papacy == confronted with heavy fire, alfonso ii reached out to [[charlemagne]]'s franks. he sent delegations to [[toulouse]] and [[aix-la-chapelle]] in 796, 797, and 798. these diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of asturias against ongoing internal unrest——troubles in galicia——and external attacks of the ibn mugait brothers, i.e. generals abd al-karim and abd al-malik.  alfonso was acknowledged as a king by charlemagne and the pope, and asturias as a kingdom for the first time. the king showed an interest in the frankish cult of saint [[martin of tours]], and most notably he encouraged carolingian church influence into asturias. unsurprisingly, during alfonso's reign, the alleged resting-place of st. james was revealed. alfonso's envoys to charlemagne's courts may have also dealt with the [[adoptionist]] controversy, which had brought bermudo's kingdom into charlemagne's view. it seems that carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into andalusian territory up to [[lisbon]]. the andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.  == later events == in 825 he defeated cordovan forces at [[narón]] and [[anceo]] (825) and, thanks to these victories, the "repopulation" of parts of [[gallaecia|galicia]], [[león (province)|león]], and [[castile (historical region)|castile]] was started—charter granting that confirmed the possession of the territories.  alfonso also moved the capital from [[pravia]], where silo had located it, to [[oviedo]], the city of his father's founding and his birth. there he constructed churches and a palace. he built [[san tirso]], where he is buried, and [[santullano]], on the outskirts. the ''crónica sebastianense'' records his death in 842, saying:  :''tras haber llevado por 52 años casta, sobria, inmaculada, piadosa y gloriosamente el gobierno del reino''  :[after having held for 52 years chastely, soberly, immaculately, piously, and gloriously the government of the realm]  tradition relates that in 814, the body of [[saint james the greater]] was discovered in [[santiago de compostela|compostela]] and that alfonso was the first pilgrim to that famous medieval (and modern) shrine.  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== {{commons category|alfonso ii

===numbers defined by radicals=== all numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of integer [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking ''n''th roots where ''n'' is a positive integer (i.e., [[radical expression]]s) are algebraic. the converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. all of these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree ≥5. this is a result of [[galois theory]] (see [[quintic equation]]s and the [[abel–ruffini theorem]]). an example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>5</sup> − ''x'' − 1}} (which is approximately 1.167304).  ===closed-form number=== {{main|closed-form number}} algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. one may generalize this to "[[closed-form number]]s", which may be defined in various ways. most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called "elementary numbers", and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. most narrowly, one may consider numbers ''explicitly'' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as ''e'' or log(2).  ==algebraic integers== {{main|algebraic integer}} [[image:leadingcoeff.png|thumb|algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer)]] an '''[[algebraic integer]]''' is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). examples of algebraic integers are {{nowrap|5 + 13√{{overline|2}}}}, {{nowrap|2 − 6''i''}}, and {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2}}(1 + ''i''√{{overline|3}}).}} note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{nowrap|''x'' − ''k''}} for all {{nowrap|''k'' ∈ '''z'''.}} in this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what [[integer]]s are to [[rational number]]s.  the sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. the name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. if ''k'' is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in ''k'', and is frequently denoted as ''o<sub>k</sub>''. these are the prototypical examples of [[dedekind domain]]s.  ==special classes of algebraic number==

allene is [[propadiene]]. compounds with an allene-type structure but with more than three carbon atoms are called [[cumulene]]s. allenes are much more reactive than most other [[alkene]]s. for

''[[american alligator|a. mississippiensis]]'' in the [[southeastern united states]], which can grow to 15&nbsp;ft (4.6&nbsp;m) and weigh 1000&nbsp;lbs

(1.5&nbsp;m). their name derives from the [[spanish language|spanish]] ''el lagarto'', which means "the lizard".  == caimans == in [[central america|central]] and [[south america]], the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily [[caimaninae]], which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony [[scute]]s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. besides the three species in ''[[caiman (genus)|caiman]]'', the smooth-fronted caimans in genus ''[[paleosuchus]]'' and the black caiman in ''[[melanosuchus]]'' are described. caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators.<ref

the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family.  although caimans have not been studied in depth, scientists have learned their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring.  == differences from crocodiles ==  [[alligator]]s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the [[crocodile]]; in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips; and an intolerance to salinity, alligators strongly preferring fresh water, while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt. in general, crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators. another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and american alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/alligators_eat_fruit.php |author=naish, darren |date=3 october 2008 |title=tetrapod zoology: alligators eat fruit

2008}}  an '''allocution''', or '''allocutus''', is a formal statement made to the court by the defendant who has been found guilty prior to being sentenced. it is part of the criminal procedure in some jurisdictions using [[common law]].  == concept == an allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient. in [[plea bargain]]s, an allocution may be required of the defendant. the defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence.  in principle, that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter.  the term "allocution" is used generally only in jurisdictions in the united states, but there are vaguely similar processes in other [[common law countries]]. in many other jurisdictions, it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on his client's behalf, and the defendant rarely has the opportunity to speak.  the right of victims to speak at sentencing is also sometimes referred to as allocution.<ref>{{citation|volume=26|publisher=st. mary's l.j.|pages=1103|date=1994–1995|title=would you like more salt with that wound - post-sentence victim allocution in texas|author=nicholson, keith d.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/stmlj26&section=44}}</ref>  ==australia== in [[australia]], the term ''allocutus'' is used by the clerk of arraigns or another formal associate of the court. it is generally phrased as, "prisoner at the bar, you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the offense of xyz. do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this court should not now be passed upon you?" the defense counsel will then make a ''plea in mitigation'' (also called ''submissions on penalty'') in an attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendant's previous good character and good works, if any.  the right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute. if a judge or magistrate refused to hear such a plea or obviously did not properly consider it, the sentence could be overturned on appeal.  ==united states== in most of the [[united states]], defendants are allowed the opportunity to allocute before a sentence is passed. some jurisdictions hold that as an absolute right. in its absence, a sentence but not the conviction may be overturned, resulting in the need for a new sentencing hearing. in the federal system, [[federal rule of criminal procedure]] 32(i)(4) provides that the court must "address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence."<ref>https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule32.htm</ref>  the [[federal public defender]] recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory directives set forth in

[[cantor function]] on the [[unit interval]] is 0 for almost all numbers in the unit interval.]]  in [[mathematics]], the phrase "'''almost all'''" has a number of specialised uses which extend its intuitive meaning.  ==cardinality==  referring to a subset of an infinite set, "almost all" is sometimes used synonymously with "all but [except] [[finite set|finite]]ly many" (that is, it is a [[cofinite]] subset). a simple example is that almost all prime numbers are odd, which is based on the fact that all but one prime number are odd. (the exception is the number 2, which is prime but not odd.)  referring to a subset of an uncountable set, "almost all" is sometimes used to mean all the elements except for a [[countable set]]" (that is, it is a [[cocountable]] subset).  ==measure theory== when speaking about the [[real number|reals]], sometimes it means "all reals but a set of [[lebesgue measure]] zero" (formally, [[almost everywhere]]). in this sense almost all reals are not a member of the [[cantor set]] even though the cantor set is [[uncountable set|uncountable]].  more generally, "almost all" is sometimes used in the sense of "[[almost everywhere]]" in [[measure theory]], or in the closely related sense of "[[almost surely]]" in [[probability theory]].  ==number theory== in [[number theory]], if ''p''(''n'') is a property of [[positive integers]], and if ''p''(''n'') denotes the number of positive integers ''n'' less than ''n'' for which ''p''(''n'') holds, and if  :''p''(''n'')/''n'' → 1 as ''n'' → ∞  (see [[limit of a sequence|limit]]), then we say that "''p''(''n'') holds for almost all positive integers ''n''" (formally, [[asymptotically almost surely]]).  for example, the [[prime number theorem]] states that the number of [[prime numbers]] less than or equal to ''n'' is asymptotically equal to ''n''/ln ''n''. therefore, the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1/ln ''n'', which tends to 0. thus, ''almost all'' positive integers are [[composite number|composite]] (not prime), however there are still an infinite number of primes.  ==see also== *[[generic property]]

was a son of [[louis viii of france|louis viii]], [[king of france]] and [[blanche of castile]]. he was a younger brother of [[louis ix of france]] and an older brother of [[charles i of sicily]]. in 1229, his mother, who was [[regent]] of [[kingdom of france|france]], forced the [[treaty of paris (1229)|treaty of paris]] on [[raymond vii of toulouse]] after his rebellion.<ref>jackson. p. 64.</ref> it stipulated that a brother of king louis was to marry [[joan of toulouse]], daughter of raymond vii of toulouse, and so in 1237 alphonse married her.<ref>fawtier. p. 123.</ref> since she was raymond's only child, they became rulers of [[toulouse]] at raymond's death in 1249.  by the terms of his father's will he received an ''[[appanage]]'' of [[poitou]] and [[rulers of auvergne|auvergne]]. to enforce this louis ix won the [[battle of taillebourg]] in the [[saintonge war]] together with alphonse against a revolt allied with king henry iii of england, who also participated in the battle.  === crusades === alphonse took part in two crusades with his brother, st louis, in 1248 (the [[seventh crusade]]) and in 1270 (the [[eighth crusade]]). for the first of these, he raised a large sum and a substantial force, arriving in [[damietta]] on 24 october 1249, after the town had already been captured.<ref>strayer. pp. 496-7.</ref> he sailed for home on 10 august 1250.<ref>strayer. p. 505.</ref> his father-in-law had died while he was away, and he went directly to toulouse to take possession.<ref>hallam. p. 218.</ref> there was some resistance to his accession as count, which was suppressed with the help of his mother blanche of castile who was acting as regent in the absence of louis ix.<ref name="wptmus">hallam. p. 258.</ref> the county of toulouse, since then, was joined to alphonse's ''appanage''.  === later life === in 1252, on the death of his mother, blanche of castile, alphonse was joint regent with [[charles of anjou]] until the return of louis ix.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} during that time he took a great part in the campaigns and negotiations which led to the [[treaty of paris (1259)|treaty of paris]] in 1259, under which king [[henry iii of england]] recognized his loss of continental territory to [[france]] (including [[normandy]], [[maine (province of france)|maine]], [[anjou]], and [[poitou]]) in exchange for france withdrawing support from english rebels.  [[file:arms of alphonse de poitiers.svg|thumb|upright|alphonse's [[coat of arms]] was formed of those of france (left) and castile (right), representing his father and mother respectively: ''per pale azure semé-de-lis or dimidiating gules semé of castles or'']]  aside from the crusades, alphonse stayed primarily in paris, governing his estates by officials, inspectors who reviewed the officials work, and a constant stream of messages.<ref>petit-dutaillis. pp. 299-300.</ref> his main work was on his own estates. there he repaired the evils of the [[albigensian crusade|albigensian war]] and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. the charter known as "alphonsine," granted to the town of [[riom]], became the code of public law for [[auvergne (province)|auvergne]]. honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  he is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of [[jew]]s, when he did so in poitou in 1249.  when louis ix again engaged in a crusade (the [[eighth crusade]]), alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother.<ref>strayer. p. 511.</ref> this time, however, he did not return to france, dying while on his way back, probably at [[savona]] in italy, on 21 august 1271.  ==death and legacy== alphonse's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands. one possibility was that they should revert to the crown, another that they should be redistributed to his family. the latter was claimed by charles of anjou, but in 1283 [[parlement]] decided that the county of toulouse should revert to the crown, if there were no male heirs.<ref name="wptmus"/> alphonse's wife joan (who died four days after alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. joan was the only surviving child and heiress of [[raymond vii]], count of toulouse, duke of narbonne, and marquis of provence, so under provençal and french law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. but, her will was invalidated by parlement in 1274.<ref name="wptmus"/> one specific bequest in alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the [[comtat venaissin]] to the [[holy see]], was allowed, and it became a [[papal states|papal territory]], a status that it retained until 1791.  ==see also== {{portal bar|biography|france}} * [[abraham

bardentreffen festival in [[nuremberg]] 2009.]]  the '''alphorn''' or '''alpenhorn''' or '''alpine horn''' is a [[brass instrument|labrophone]], consisting of a wooden [[natural horn]] of [[bore (wind instruments)|conical bore]], having a wooden cup-shaped [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]], used by mountain dwellers in the [[swiss alps]], [[austria|austrian alps]], [[bavarian alps]] in [[germany]], [[french alps]], and elsewhere. similar wooden horns were used for [[communication]] in most mountainous regions of [[europe]], from the [[alps]] to the [[carpathian mountains|carpathians]].  for a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the roman-etruscan [[lituus]], because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word ''liti'', meaning alphorn in the dialect of [[obwalden]].{{citation needed|date=june 2015}} there is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word ''liti'' was probably borrowed from 16th–18th century writings in latin, where the word ''lituus'' could describe various wind instruments, such as the [[natural horn|horn]], the [[crumhorn]], or the [[cornett]].{{clarify|date=june 2015}}<!--does this mean that the dialect name "liti" is not found until after the 18th century, or that it goes back much further? if the latter, were these latin writings from three centuries unanimous in using the lituus for all three of these instrument types and, further, does this mean the crumhorn was actually still in use in the 18th century?--> swiss naturalist [[conrad gesner]] used the words ''lituum alpinum'' for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his ''de raris et admirandis herbis'' in 1555. the oldest known document using the german word ''alphorn'' is a page from a 1527 account book from the former [[cistercian]] abbey st. urban near [[pfaffnau]] mentioning the payment of two [[batzen]] for an itinerant alphorn player from the [[valais]].  17th–19th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of [[church bells]]. surviving artifacts, dating back to as far as ca. ad 1400, include wooden [[brass instrument|labrophones]] in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the "büchel" and the "allgäuisches waldhorn" or "ackerhorn". the alphorn's exact origins remain indeterminate, and the ubiquity of horn-like signal instruments in valleys throughout europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage.  ==construction and qualities== [[image:alphorn player in wallis.jpg|thumb|right|a swiss playing alphorn]]  the alphorn is carved from solid [[softwood]], generally spruce but sometimes pine. in former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn, but modern makers piece the wood together at the base. a cup-shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete.  an alphorn made at rigi-kulm, schwyz, and now in the [[victoria and albert museum]], measures {{convert|8|ft|m}} in length and has a straight tube. the swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality, being curved near the bell in the bernese oberland. [[michael praetorius]] mentions an alphorn-like instrument under the name of hölzern trummet (wooden trumpet) in ''syntagma musicum'' (wittenberg, 1615–1619; pl. viii).<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=alpenhorn, alphorn|volume=1|page=723|first=kathleen|last=schlesinger|authorlink=kathleen schlesinger}}</ref>  the alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure [[harmonic series (music)|natural harmonic series]] of the open pipe.<ref name="eb1911"/> the notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard western [[equal temperament]]. most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale. [[image:harmonic series.png|thumb|center|600px]]  accomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves, consisting of the 2nd through the 16th notes of the harmonic series. the availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn.  [[image:alphorn-mj.jpg|thumb|right|d'dieß'ner alphorn players.]] the well-known "[[ranz des vaches]]" ([https://web.archive.org/web/19980214205945/http://www.lyoba.ch/culture/desalpe/ranz.htm#partition score]; [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?sid=7020216&ckey=1183635931000&ty=st&rubricid=25004&sitesect=25001 audio]) is a traditional swiss melody often heard on the alphorn. the song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. [[gioachino rossini|rossini]] introduced the "ranz des vaches" into his masterpiece ''william tell,'' along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well-suited to the alphorn. [[johannes brahms|brahms]] wrote to [[clara schumann]] that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his [[symphony no. 1 (brahms)|first symphony]] was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the rigi area of switzerland.  ==music for alphorn== [[image:fanfare 27bca 01.jpg|thumb|the military band of the french [[chasseurs

[[hispania]], son of widerich (born {{circa|lk=no|450}}), grandson of berismund (born {{circa|lk=no|410}}), and great-grandson of [[valamir|thorismund]] (died after 400), [[king of the ostrogoths]] {{circa|lk=no|400}}. it was important to amalasuntha's father, [[theoderic the great]], that she marry into a legitimate royal family, lest her own family's legitimacy be questioned.<ref name=":1" />

the last name of a family of [[italy|italian]] [[violin]] makers, who lived at [[cremona]] from about 1538 to 1740.  their importance is considered equal to those of the [[carlo bergonzi (luthier)|bergonzi]], [[guarneri]] and [[stradivarius|stradivari]] families. today, violins created by nicolò amati are valued at around $600,000.<ref>[http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm

designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the "violin family". he standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. makers from nearby [[brescia]] experimented, such as gasparo da salò, micheli, zanetto and pellegrino, but it was andrea amati in cremona, italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.  the first violin was ordered by [[lorenzo de medici|lorenzo de' medici]] in 1555. his letter to amati stated the instrument was to be "made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play". the first violin was intended to be used by illiterate musicians, so the design was simple and it was easy to play. what became of this first violin is not known. a number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (amati made the first cello called "the king" in 1538 [1]) and 1574. the largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by [[catherine de medici|catherine de médicis]] the regent queen of france and bore hand painted royal french decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son [[charles ix of france]]. of these 38 instruments ordered, amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. they were in use until the french revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. his work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design.

"the brothers amati", as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the [[f-holes]]. they are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that [[gasparo da salo]] made violas ranging from altos of 39&nbsp;cm to tenors of 44.7&nbsp;cm.  ===nicolo amati=== {{main|nicolò amati}} '''nicolò amati''' (december 3, 1596{{snd}}april 12, 1684) was the son of girolamo amati. he was the most eminent of the family. he improved the model adopted by the rest of the amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[timbre|tone]].<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=amati|volume=1|page=783}}</ref> his pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the "grand amati", which have become his most sought-after violins.  of his pupils, the most famous were [[antonio stradivari]] and [[andrea guarneri]],<ref name="eb1911"/> the first of the guarneri family of violin makers. (there is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of antonio stradivari. while the label on stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of amati, the validity of his statement is

northern france, luxembourg, part of present-day netherlands below the [[rhine]] river; and the north-western portion of north rhine-westphalia, germany). there were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently. the [[eburones]] were ruled by ambiorix and [[catuvolcus]]. in 54 bc caesar's troops urgently needed more food, and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their [[harvest]], which had not been good that year. understandably the [[starving]] eburones were reluctant to do so and caesar ordered that [[military camp|camps]] be built near the eburones' villages. each [[centurion]] was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the [[ancient rome|roman]] [[soldiers]]. this created resentment among the eburones.  although [[julius caesar]] had freed him from paying tribute to the [[atuatuci]], ambiorix joined [[catuvolcus]] in the winter of 54 bc in an uprising against the [[roman republic|roman]] forces under [[quintus titurius sabinus|q. titurius sabinus]] and [[lucius aurunculeius cotta|l. aurunculeius cotta]].  ==resisting the romans== {{main|ambiorix's revolt}} [[image:liège, palais provincial, épisodes des guerres d'ambiorix.jpg|thumb|ambiorix attacking roman soldiers, relief at the liège provincial palace]] because a drought had disrupted his grain supply, caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious belgic tribes. roman troops led by q. titurius sabinus and l. aurunculeius cotta were wintering among the eburones when they were attacked by them, led by ambiorix and cativolcus. ambiorix deceived the romans, telling them the attack was made without his consent, and further advised them to flee as a large germanic force was preparing to cross the rhine. trusting ambiorix, sabinus and cotta's troops left the next morning. a short distance from their camp, the roman troops were ambushed by the eburones and massacred.  elsewhere, another roman force under [[quintus tullius cicero|q. tullius cicero]], brother of the orator [[marcus tullius cicero|marcus]], were wintering amongst the nervii. leading a coalition of rebellious belgic tribes, ambiorix surrounded cicero's camp. after a long while, a roman messenger was finally able to slip through the belgic lines and get word of the uprising to caesar. mobilizing his legions, caesar immediately marched to cicero's aid. as they approached the besieged roman camp, the belgae moved to engage caesar's troops. vastly outnumbered, caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened, and they successfully lured the belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the romans. caesar's forces launched a fierce counterattack, and soon put the belgae to flight. later, caesar's troops entered cicero's camp to find most of the men wounded.  meanwhile, indutiomarus, a leader of the treveri, began to harass labienus's camp daily, eventually provoking labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill indutiomarus. they did so, and routed the remnants of indutiomarus's army. caesar personally remained in gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed gallic threat.  ==caesar's revenge== when the [[roman senate]] heard what had happened, caesar swore to put down all the belgic tribes. ambiorix had killed a whole roman [[roman legion#imperial legion|legion]] and five [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]. a belgic attack on q. tullius cicero, then stationed with a legion in the territory of the [[nervii]], failed due to the timely appearance of caesar. the roman campaigns against the belgae took a few years, but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. the eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event. according to the writer [[florus]], ambiorix and his men succeeded in crossing the [[rhine]] and disappeared without a trace.<ref>[[florus]], iii. 10. § 8</ref>  ==legacy== caesar wrote about ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the gauls, ''[[de bello gallico]]''. in this text he also wrote the famous line: "of these [three regions], the belgae are the bravest." ("...&nbsp;''horum omnium fortissimi sunt belgae''&nbsp;...").  ambiorix remained a relatively obscure figure until the nineteenth century. when belgium became independent in 1830 the national government{{who|date=january 2015}} started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as [[national heroes]]. in caesar's ''de bello gallico'', ambiorix and his deeds was rediscovered. in 1841 the belgian poet joannes nolet de brauwere van steeland wrote a [[lyric poetry|lyric]]al [[epic poetry|epic]] about ambiorix and on september 5, 1866 a statue of ambiorix was

[[hydroxide]]. the mineral occurs in [[pegmatite]] deposits and is easily mistaken for [[albite]] and other [[feldspar]]s. its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. amblygonite forms a series with ''montebrasite'', the low fluorine endmember. geologic occurrence is in [[granite]] pegmatites, high-temperature [[tin]] veins, and [[greisen]]s. amblygonite occurs with [[spodumene]], [[apatite]], [[lepidolite]], [[tourmaline]], and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins.  it contains about 10% lithium, and has been utilized as a source of lithium. the chief commercial sources have historically been the deposits of california and france.  ==history== the mineral was first discovered in [[saxony]] by [[august breithaupt]] in 1817, and named by him from the greek ''amblus'', blunt, and ''gonia'', angle, because of the obtuse angle between the cleavages. later it was found at montebras, creuse, [[france]], and at hebron in [[maine]]; and because of slight differences in optical character and chemical composition the names montebrasite and hebronite have been applied to the mineral from these localities.  it has been discovered in considerable quantity at pala in san diego county, [[california]];  caceres, [[spain]]; and the [[black hills]] of [[south dakota]]. the largest documented single crystal of amblygonite measured 7.62×2.44×1.83

periander its government developed into a strong democracy.  the early policy of ambracia was determined by its loyalty to corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[epirus]]

corcyra (modern corfu) and [[ancient corinth|corinth]]).{{sfn|caspari|1911}}  ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the [[amphilochians]] and [[acarnanians]].  hence it took a

detecting its value belongs to [[gaston paris]], although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the ''[[monumenta germaniae historica]]'', who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their scriptores (1885). ambroise followed richard i as a [[noncombatant]], and not improbably as a court-[[minstrel]]. he speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at [[messina, italy|messina]], in [[cyprus]],  at the [[siege of acre (1189–1191)|siege of acre]], and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.<ref name="eb1911"/>  ambroise is surprisingly accurate in his [[chronology]]; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his [[pilgrimage]].  he shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention. he is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the [[saracens]], against the french, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the ''polein'' party which supported [[conrad of montferrat]] against [[guy of lusignan]]. he is rather to be treated as a [[biographer]] than as a historian of the crusade in its broader aspects. nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190–1192 in the [[kingdom of jerusalem]].<ref name="eb1911"/>  books 2–6 of the ''[[itinerarium regis ricardi]]'', a latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by richard, a canon

'''ambrosians''' are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around [[milan]] and also a 16th-century sect of [[anabaptist ambrosians]].  ==orders== [[file:ambroseofmilan.jpg|thumb|225px|late antique mosaic of saint ambrose (~337-397) in [[sant'ambrogio]] church, [[milan]], [[lombardy]], [[italy]], possibly an actual portrait made in his lifetime]].  only the oldest of the catholic ambrosians, the fratres s. ambrosii ad nemus, had anything more than a very local significance. this order is known from a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[pope gregory xi]] addressed to the [[monk]]s of the church of st ambrose outside milan.<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=ambrosians|volume=1|page=800}} this further references herzog-hauck's [[schaff–herzog encyclopedia of religious knowledge|''realencyklopadie'']], i. 439.</ref>  saint [[ambrose]], bishop of milan, certainly did not found [[religious orders#catholic tradition|religious orders]], though he took an interest in the [[christian monasticism|monastic life]] and watched over its beginnings in his [[diocese]], providing for the needs of a [[monastery]] outside the walls of milan, as [[augustine of hippo|saint augustine]] recounts in his ''[[confessions (st. augustine)|confessions]]''. ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of virgins, as also of widows. his exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings: ''de virginibus'', ''de viduis'', ''de virginitate'', ''de institutione virginis'', ''de exhortatione virginitatis'', and ''de lapsu virginis consecratae''. ambrose was the only father of the church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of  communities which later became formal monasteries of women.  it is against this background that two religious orders or congregations—one of men and one of women, when founded in the milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries—took saint ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.  ===order of st ambrose=== the first of these groups was formed in a wood outside milan by three noble milanese, alexander grivelli, antonio petrasancta, and albert besuzzi, who were joined by others, including some  priests. in 1375 [[pope gregory xi]] gave them the rule of st augustine, with set of constitutions. as a canonically recognized order they took the name "fratres sancti ambrosii ad nemus" and adopted a habit consisting of a brown [[tunic]], [[scapular]], and hood. the brethren elected a superior with the title of [[prior]] who was then instituted by the [[archbishop of milan]]. the priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes. in the liturgy they followed the [[ambrosian rite]]. various monasteries were founded on these lines, but without any formal bond between them. in 1441 [[pope eugene iv]] merged them into one congregation called "congregatio sancti ambrosii ad nemus", made the original house the main seat, and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years, elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter. there was a rector, or superior general, who was assisted by two "visitors".  saint charles borromeo, archbishop of milan, successfully reformed their discipline, grown lax, in 1579. in 1589 [[pope sixtus v]] united to the congregation of st ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the "brothers of the apostles of the poor life" (or  "apostolini" or "brothers of st. barnabas"), whose houses were in the province of genoa and in the march of ancona. this was an order that had been founded by giovanni scarpa at the end of the 15th century. the union  was confirmed by [[pope paul v]] in 1606, at which time the congregation added the name of st. barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions, divided its houses into four provinces, two of them, st clement's and st pancras's, being in rome. published works have survived from the pen of ascanio tasca and michele mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of zaccaria visconti, francesco-maria guazzi and paolo fabulotti. although various ambrosians were given the title of blessed in recognition of their holiness: antonio gonzaga of mantua, filippo of fermo, and gerardo of monza, the order was eventually dissolved by [[pope innocent x]] in 1650.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  ===nuns=== the nuns of st ambrose (ambrosian sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the brothers of st ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the [[ambrosian rite]], but were independent in government. [[pope sixtus iv]] gave the nuns canonical status in 1474. their one monastery was on the top of monte varese, near lago maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the blessed catarina morigia (or catherine of palanza), had first led a solitary life.  other early nuns were the blessed juliana of puriselli, benedetta bimia, and lucia alciata. the nuns were esteemed by st charles borromeo.  another group of cloistered "nuns of st ambrose", also called the annunciatae (italian: ''annunziate'') of lombardy or "sisters of st marcellina", were founded in 1408 by three young women of pavia, dorothea morosini, eleonora contarini, and veronica duodi. their houses, scattered throughout lombardy and venetia, were united into a congregation by st pius v, under the rule of st augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at pavia. one of the nuns in this group was saint [[catharine fieschi adorno]], who died on september 14, 1510.  ===oblates of st. ambrose and of st. charles=== in some sense also "ambrosians" are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by st [[charles borromeo]], archbishop of milan. all priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. the model for this was a society that already existed at brescia, under the name of "priests of peace". in august 1578 the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the holy sepulchre and given the name of "oblates of st. ambrose." they later received the approbation of gregory xiii. st charles died in 1584. these oblates were dispersed by [[napoleon i]] in 1810, while another group called the oblates of our lady of rho escaped this fate. in 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of "oblates of st. charles" and reassigned the house of the holy sepulchre. in the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the "oblates of st charles", established in london by cardinal nicholas wiseman.  today, the oblates of st. ambrose and of st. charles is divided into four "families" or groups:  *the '''missionary oblates of rho''' (obl. rho), founded in 1714 by giorgio maria martinelli and dedicated to preaching retreats, spiritual exercises, and popular missions. *the '''oblates vicars''' was founded in 1875 and tasked with advising and assisting in the management of parishes and diocesan shrines. *the '''oblates diocesan''' consists of priests engaged in pastoral work, parishes, schools.  *the '''oblats laics''' a lay order founded in 1932 by archbishop schuster. they follow temporary vows of chastity and obedience with a focus on service tasks (administrative, nursing, technical, etc.) and missionary work.  in 1980 there were 17 missionaries rho, 24 vicars, 160 diocesan and 60 laymen, all in the archdiocese of milan.  ==see also== *[[ambrosian rite]] *[[st. ambrose]] *[[st. ambrose university]]  ==references== {{reflist}} *{{catholic|wstitle=ambrosians}}  [[category:anabaptism]] [[category:baptism]] [[category:premillennialism]]AmbrosiusBosschaert | {{infobox artist | name          = ambrosius bosschaert | image         = ambrosius bosschaert the elder (dutch -

[[hannibal]] encamped within striking distance of the romans with the trebia river between them, and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment, near the battle zone. he had noticed, says polybius, a "place between the two camps, flat indeed and treeless, but well adapted for an ambuscade, as it was traversed by a water-course with steep banks, densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants, and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy". when the roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army, the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear. the result was slaughter and defeat for the romans. nevertheless, the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force. although most of the legions were lost, about 10,000 romans cut their way through to safety, maintaining [[unit cohesion]]. this ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a [[kill zone]] is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation. (see ranger reference below).  another famous ambush was that sprung by germanic warchief [[arminius]] against the romans at [[battle of the teutoburg forest]]. this particular ambush was to affect the course of western history. the germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush. they took cover in difficult forested terrain, allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection. they had the element of surprise, and this was also aided by the defection of arminius from roman ranks prior to the battle. they sprang the attack when the romans were most vulnerable; when they had left their fortified camp, and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm.   the germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly, using a massive series of short, rapid, vicious charges against the length of the whole roman line, with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place. the germans also used blocking obstacles, erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder roman movement along the route of the killing zone. the result was mass slaughter of the romans, and the destruction of three legions. the germanic victory caused a limit on roman expansion in the west. ultimately, it established the rhine as the boundary of the roman empire for the next four hundred years, until the decline of the roman influence in the west. the roman empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer germania beyond the rhine.  ===arabia during muhammad's era=== {{main|list of battles of muhammad}} according to muslim tradition, islamic prophet [[muhammad]] used ambush tactics in his military campaigns. his first such use was during the [[caravan raids]], in the kharrar caravan raid sa`d ibn abi waqqas was ordered to lead a raid against the [[quraysh tribe|quraysh]]. his group consisted of about twenty muhajirs. this raid was done about a month after the previous. sa'd, with his soldiers, set up an ambush in the valley of [[kharrar]] on the road to mecca and waited to raid a returning meccan caravan from syria. but the caravan had already passed and the muslims returned to medina without any loot.<ref name="mubarakpuri, the sealed nectar p. 127">mubarakpuri, the sealed nectar (free version), p. 127.</ref><ref name="haykal 1976">{{citation|title=the life of muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foyo-tso5nec&printsec=frontcover |first=husayn |last=haykal|year=1976|publisher=islamic book trust |isbn=978-983-9154-17-7|pages=217–218}}</ref>  arab tribes during muhammad's era also used ambush tactics.{{fact|date=august 2015}}  one example retold in muslim tradition is said to have taken place during the [[first raid on banu thalabah]]. the banu thalabah tribe were already aware of the impending attack;

'''ambush units:''' the nva/vc ambush formations consisted of: * lead-blocking element * main-assault element * rear-blocking element * observation posts * command post  other elements might also be included if the situation demanded, such as a sniper screen along a nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcement.  '''command posts:''' when deploying into an ambush site, the nva first occupied several observation posts, placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using, its strength and firepower, as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander. usually one main op and several secondary op's were established. runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the op's and the main command post. the op's were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options. frequently the op's were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security. the command post was situated in a central location, often on terrain which afforded it a vantage point overlooking the ambush site.  '''recon methods:''' recon elements observing a potential ambush target on the move generally stayed 300–500 meters away. sometimes a "leapfrogging" recon technique was used. surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other. as the enemy drew close to the first, it fell back behind the last recon team, leaving an advance group in its place. this one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap, and the cycle rotated. this method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from a variety of vantage points, and allowed the recon groups to cover one another.<ref name="rand corp">rand corp, "insurgent organization and operations: a case study of the viet cong in the delta, 1964–1966," (santa monica: august 1967)</ref>  ==see also== * [[ambush predator]] * [[viet cong and pavn battle tactics#offensive tactics|viet cong and pavn battle tactics]] * [[flanking maneuver]] * [[flypaper theory (strategy)]] * [[list of military tactics]] * [[sniper]] {{clear}}  ==references== {{reflist}} *[http://www.angelfire.com/art/enchanter/herbert.html extract from lt col anthony b. herbert's soldiers handbook] *[http://www.scribd.com/doc/100897/ebook-us-army-ranger-handbook us army ranger handbook] section 5-14 for ambushes and 6-11 for reaction to ambushes  ==external links==  {{authority control}} {{defaultsort:ambush}} [[category:assault tactics]] [[category:military tactics]] [[category:guerrilla warfare tactics]] [[category:ambushes| ]]AMDAthlon | #redirect [[athlon]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from alternative name}} }}Ameboidstage | #redirect [[amoeba]]AmericaIslands | #redirect [[line islands]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from alternative name}} }}AmericanAirlinesflight11 | #redirect [[american airlines flight 11]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from other capitalisation}} }}Americanbias | #redirect [[americentrism]]AmericanFolklore | #redirect [[folklore of the united states]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from alternative name}} {{r from other capitalisation}} }}Americanindian | #redirect [[american indians]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from other capitalisation}} }}Americanpoliticalscandals | #redirect[[list of federal political scandals in the united states]]AmericanSamoaMilitary | #redirect [[american samoa]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}Americanshot | {{use dmy dates|date=june 2013}} {{refimprove|date=june 2007}}  {{main|cinematic techniques}}  "'''american shot'''" is a translation of a phrase from [[france|french]] [[film criticism]], "''plan américain''" and refers to a medium-long ("knee") [[shot (filming)|film shot]] of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. the usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. the purpose of the composition is to allow complex [[dialogue]] scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. in some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.<ref>{{cite web|title=elements of cinematography: camera|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/atec/midori/handouts/camera.htm#ms|website=www.utdallas.edu|publisher=[[university of texas at dallas]]|accessdate=1 december 2015}}</ref>  one of the other main reasons why french critics called it 'american shot' was its frequent use in westerns. this was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy, usually holstered at his waist. it's actually the closest you can get to an actor while keeping both his face and his holstered gun in frame.  the french critics thought it was characteristic of [[cinema of the united states|american films]] of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of ''cheaper'' american movies, such as [[charlie chan]] mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.

diogenes laertius, i. 101; although [[lucian]], (''scytha'') calls him the son of daucetas.</ref> a scythian chief, was half greek and from a mixed hellenic culture, apparently in the region of the [[cimmerian bosporus]]. he left his native country to travel in pursuit of knowledge, and came to athens about 589 bc,<ref>sosicrates, ap diogenes laertius, i. 101</ref> at a time when [[solon]] was occupied with [[solonian constitution|his legislative measures]].  according to the story recounted by [[hermippus of smyrna|hermippus]],<ref>hermippus, ap diogenes laertius, i. 101-2</ref> anacharsis arrived at the house of solon and said, "i have traveled here from afar to make you my friend." solon replied, "it's better to make friends at home." thereupon the scythian replied, "then it is necessary for you, being at home, to make friends with me."  solon laughed and accepted him as his friend.  anacharsis cultivated the outsider's knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things. for example, plutarch remarks that he "expressed his wonder at the fact that in greece wise men spoke and fools decided."<ref>plutarch ''solon'' 5 [[s:lives (dryden translation)/solon#5]]</ref> his conversation was droll and frank, and solon and the athenians took to him as a sage and philosopher. his rough and free discourse became proverbial among athenians as 'scythian discourse'.<ref>diogenes laertius, i. 101</ref>  anacharsis was the first foreigner ([[metic]]) who received the privileges of athenian citizenship. he was reckoned by some ancient authors as one of the [[seven sages of greece]],<ref>diogenes laertius, i. 41-2</ref> and it is said that he was initiated into the [[eleusinian mysteries]] of the great goddess, a privilege denied to those who did not speak fluent [[ancient greek|greek]].  according to [[herodotus]],<ref>herodotus, iv, 76; comp. diogenes laertius, i. 102</ref> when anacharsis returned to the scythians he was killed by his own brother for his greek ways and especially for the impious attempt to sacrifice to the mother goddess [[cybele]], whose cult was unwelcome among the scythians.  ==ideas== [[image:nuremberg chronicles f 60r 1.png|right|thumb|anacharsis, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[nuremberg chronicle]]'']] none of the works ascribed to him in [[ancient history|ancient times]], if indeed they were written by him, have survived. he was said to have written a book comparing the laws of the scythians with the laws of the greeks, as well as work on the art of war. all that remains of his thought is what later tradition ascribes to him. he became famous for the simplicity of his way of living and his acute observations on the institutions and customs of the greeks. he exhorted moderation in everything, saying that the vine bears three clusters of grapes: the first wine, pleasure; the second, drunkenness; the third, disgust.<ref>diogenes laertius, i. 103</ref> so he became a kind of [[emblem]] to the athenians, who inscribed on his statues: 'restrain your tongues, your appetites, your passions.'  there are ten extant letters ascribed to him, one of which is also quoted by [[cicero]]: <blockquote>greetings from anacharsis to hanno: my clothing is a scythian cloak, my shoes are the hard soles of my feet, my bed is the earth, my food is only seasoned by hunger - and i eat nothing but milk and cheese and meat. come and visit me, and you will find me at peace. you want to give me something. but give it to your fellow-citizens instead, or let the immortal gods have it.<ref>pseudo-anacharsis, ''epistle'' 5, quoted in cicero, ''[[tusculan disputations]]'', v. 32</ref></blockquote>   all of the letters are spurious.<ref name="malherbe">abraham j. malherbe, (1977), ''the cynic epistles: a study edition'', pages 6-7. sbl</ref> the first nine probably date from the 3rd century bc, they are usually included among the ''[[cynic epistles]]'', and reflect how the cynic philosophers viewed him as prefiguring many of their ideas;<ref name="malherbe"/> the tenth letter is quoted by [[diogenes laertius]], it is addressed to [[croesus]], the proverbially rich king of [[lydia]], it too is fictitious:  <blockquote>anacharsis to croesus: o king of the lydians, i am come to the country of the greeks, in order to become acquainted with their customs and institutions;

people|greek]] [[philosopher]] of the school of [[democritus]]. together with [[pyrrho]], he accompanied [[alexander the great]] into asia. the reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of [[pyrrhonism]].  ==life== anaxarchus was born at [[abdera, thrace|abdera]] in [[thrace]]. he was the companion and friend of [[alexander the great]] in his asiatic campaigns. according to [[diogenes laertius]], in response to alexander's claim to have been the son of zeus-ammon, anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked, "see the blood of a mortal, not [[ichor]], such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods."<ref name="laertius60">diogenes laertius, ''lives'', ix. 60</ref>  [[plutarch]] tells a story that at [[bactra]], in 327 bc in a debate with [[callisthenes]], he advised all to worship alexander as a god even during his lifetime, is with greater probability attributed to the sicilian [[cleon]].{{citation needed|date=september 2016}}  when alexander was trying to show that he is divine so that the greeks and macedonians would perform proskynesis to him, anaxarchus said that alexander could "more justly be considered a god than dionysus or heracles" (arrian, 104)  diogenes laertius says that [[nicocreon]], the tyrant of [[cyprus]], commanded him to be pounded to death in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with fortitude and [[cicero]] relates the same story.<ref name="laertius58">diogenes laertius, ''lives'', ix. 58</ref>  ==philosophy== very little is known about his philosophical views. it is thought that he represents a link between the [[atomism]] of [[democritus]], and the [[pyrrhonism|skepticism]] of [[pyrrho]].  anaxarchus is said to have studied under [[diogenes of smyrna]], who in turn studied under [[metrodorus of chios]], who used to declare that he knew nothing, not even the fact that he knew nothing.<ref name="laertius58"/> according to [[sextus empiricus]], anaxarchus "compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness."<ref>sextus empiricus, ''against the logicians'', 7.88.</ref> anaxarchus's student pyrrho is said to have adopted "a most noble philosophy,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement."<ref>diogenes laertius, ''lives'', ix. 61</ref> anaxarchus is said to have praised pyrrho's "indifference and sang-froid."<ref>diogenes laertius, ''lives'', ix. 63</ref> anaxarchus is said to have possessed "fortitude and contentment in life," which earned him the epithet ''eudaimonikos'' ("fortunate"),<ref name="laertius60"/> which may imply that he held the end of life to be ''[[eudaimonia]].''

''de amore'' is made up of three books. the first book covers the etymology and definition of love and is written in the manner of an academic lecture. the second book consists of sample dialogues between members of different social classes; it outlines how the romantic process between the classes should work. book three is made of stories from actual courts of love presided over by noble women.  [[john jay parry]], the editor of one modern edition of ''de amore'', quotes critic robert bossuat as describing ''de amore'' as "one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization".{{citation needed|date=february 2017}}  it may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive; in any event it preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in western literature.  the social system of "courtly love", as gradually elaborated by the [[provençal literature|provençal]] [[troubadour]]s from the mid twelfth century, soon spread. one of the circles in which this poetry and its ethic were cultivated was the court of eleanor of aquitaine (herself the granddaughter of an early troubadour poet, [[william ix of aquitaine]]). it has been claimed {{citation needed|date=august 2012}} that ''de amore'' codifies the social and sexual life of eleanor's court at poitiers between 1170 and 1174, though it was evidently written at least ten years later and, apparently, at troyes. it deals with several specific themes that were the subject of [[poetical debate (occitan literature)|poetical debate]] among late twelfth century troubadours and [[trobairitz]].  the meaning of ''de amore'' has been debated over the centuries. in the years immediately following its release many people took andreas’ opinions concerning [[courtly love]] seriously. in more recent times, however, scholars have come to view the priest’s work as satirical. many scholars now agree that andreas was commenting on the materialistic, superficial nature of the nobles of the middle ages. andreas seems to have been warning young walter, his protege, about love in the middle ages.  == bibliography == *andreas capellanus: ''the art of courtly love'', trans. john jay parry. new york: columbia university press, 1941.

[[sculptor]] and [[architect]], active in [[poland]], [[berlin]] and [[saint petersburg]].  ==biography== andreas schlüter was born probably in [[hamburg]]<ref>''nach älteren quellen angeblich am 20. mai 1664 in hamburg als sohn des bildhauers gerhart schlüter geboren'' - [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz78554.html#adbcontent ''andreas schlüter''], in: [[allgemeine deutsche biographie]] (adb). bd. 55, leipzig 1910, s. 184–194.</ref>  his early life is obscure as at least three different persons of that name are documented. the records of [[st. michaelis church, hamburg]] show that an andreas schlüter, son of sculptor gerhart schlüter, had been baptized there on 22 may 1664. documents from [[history of gdańsk|danzig]] (gdańsk) <!-- "in biographies of clearly german persons, the name should be used in the form danzig (gdańsk) and later danzig exclusively". do not add anything else! --> reported that an andreas schlüter ''(senior)'' had worked 1640-1652 in danzig's jopengasse lane (today's ulica piwna). possibly born in 1640, an ''andres schliter'' is recorded as apprentice on 9 may 1656 by the mason's guild. other sources state 1659 as year of birth.<ref>[[deutsches historisches museum]] online article on [[zeughaus]] [http://www.dhm.de/magazine/zeughaus/skulpturenschmuck.html]</ref>  he probably did spend several years abroad as [[journeyman]]. his first work, in 1675, may have been epitaphs of the dukes [[sambor ii, duke of pomerania|sambor]] and [[mestwin ii, duke of pomerania|mestwin]] in the dome of [[pelplin monastery]].  schlüter's first known work was the decoration of the [[facade]] of the [[danzig]] royal chapel, in 1681. he later created statues for king [[john iii sobieski]]'s [[wilanów palace]] in [[warsaw]] and sepulchral sculptures in [[zhovkva castle|żółkiew (zhovkva)]]. in 1689, he moved to warsaw and made the [[pediment]] reliefs and sculptural work of [[jan dobrogost krasiński|krasiński palace]].  schlüter was invited to [[berlin]] in 1694 by [[eberhard von danckelmann]] to work as court sculptor at the [[zeughaus|armory (''zeughaus'')]] for elector [[frederick i of prussia|frederick iii]]. his sculpted decorations are a masterpiece of baroque expression and [[pathos]]. while the more visible reliefs on the outside had to praise fighting, the statues of dying warriors in the interior denounced war and gave an indication of his pacifist religious beliefs (he is said to have been a [[mennonite]]). travelling through [[italy]] in 1696, he studied the work of masters like [[michelangelo buonarroti]] and [[gian lorenzo bernini]].  schlüter also worked as an architect and built many state buildings in berlin in his role as "hofbaumeister" (court architect), which he lost when one tower showed signs of a weak fundament. he also served as director of the [[prussian academy of arts]] from 1702 to 1704, after which he began concentrating on sculpting again, as "hofbildhauer" (court sculptor). his most important [[equestrian sculpture]] is that of the "great elector", [[frederick william, elector of brandenburg|frederick william of brandenburg]], cast in 1708 and placed at "lange brücke" near the [[berlin city palace]], now situated in the honor court before [[charlottenburg palace]].  the berlin city palace, and many of his works, were partially destroyed by bombing in [[world war ii]] and by the subsequent [[german democratic republic|communist regime]]. a similar fate probably befell the [[amber room]], made between 1701 and 1709, schlüter's most famous work of architecture.  in 1713 schlüter's fame brought him to work for tsar [[peter i of russia|peter the great]] in [[saint petersburg]], where he died of an illness after creating several designs. together with [[johann friedrich braunstein]], he designed the grand palace and [[monplaisir palace]] in [[peterhof palace complex]]. also the city's oldest building, kikin's palace, and the reliefs at the [[summer palace (saint petersburg)|summer palace]] are attributed to him. this way he became an important figure of [[petrine baroque]].  ==extant works== *[[facade]] of the royal chapel, [[gdańsk]], 1681 *sculptures on the

on [[stochastic process]]es. a primary subject of his research later became known as [[markov chain]]s and [[markov process]]es.  markov and his younger brother [[vladimir andreevich markov]] (1871–1897) proved [[markov brothers' inequality]]. his son, another [[andrey markov (soviet mathematician)|andrei andreevich markov]] (1903–1979), was also a notable mathematician, making contributions to [[constructive mathematics]] and [[recursion#functional recursion|recursive function]] theory.  == biography == andrey markov was born on 14 june 1856 in russia. he attended petersburg grammar, where he was seen as a rebellious student by a select few teachers. in his academics he performed poorly in most subjects other than mathematics (which later became his profession).  later in life he attended petersburg university and was lectured by [[pafnuty chebyshev]]. among his teachers were [[yulian sokhotski]] (differential calculus, higher algebra), [[konstantin posse]] (analytic geometry), yegor zolotarev (integral calculus), [[pafnuty chebyshev]] (number theory and probability theory), [[aleksandr korkin]] (ordinary and partial differential equations), mikhail okatov (mechanism theory), [[osip somov]] (mechanics), and nikolai budaev (descriptive and higher geometry).  he completed his studies at the university and was later asked if he would like to stay and have a career as a mathematician. he later taught at high schools and continued his own mathematical studies. in this time he found a practical use for his mathematical skills. he figured out that he could use chains to model the alliteration of vowels and consonants in russian literature. he also contributed to many other mathematical aspects in his time. he died at age 66 on 20 july 1922.  == andrey markov timeline ==  in 1877, markov was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem  ''about integration of differential equations by continuous fractions with an application to the equation'' <math> (1+x^2) \frac{dy}{dx} = n (1+y^2)</math>.  during the following year, he passed the candidate's examinations, and he remained at the university to prepare for a lecturer's position.  in april 1880, markov defended his [[master's degree|master's thesis]] "about binary quadratic forms with positive determinant", which was encouraged by aleksandr korkin and yegor zolotarev.  five years later, in january 1885, there followed his doctoral thesis "about some applications of algebraic continuous fractions".  his [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] work began after the defense of his master's thesis in autumn 1880. as a [[privatdozent]] he lectured on differential and integral calculus. later he lectured alternately on "introduction to analysis", probability theory (succeeding chebyshev, who had left the university in 1882) and the calculus of differences. from 1895 through 1905 he also lectured in [[differential calculus]].  [[file:andrei markov.jpg|right|thumb|alt=markov in 1886|markov in 1886]] one year after the defense of his doctoral thesis, markov was appointed extraordinary professor (1886) and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the academy of sciences. in 1890, after the death of viktor bunyakovsky, markov became an extraordinary member of the academy. his promotion to an ordinary professor of st. petersburg university followed in the fall of 1894.  in 1896, markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of [[chebyshev]]. in 1905, he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire, which he did immediately. until 1910, however, he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences.  in connection with student riots in 1908, professors and lecturers of st. petersburg university were ordered to monitor their students. markov refused to accept this decree, and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an "agent of the governance". markov was removed from further teaching duties at st. petersburg university, and hence he decided to retire from the university.  markov was an [[atheist]]. in 1912 he protested [[leo tolstoy]]'s excommunication from the [[russian orthodox church]] by requesting his own excommunication. the church complied with his request.<ref>"of course, markov, an atheist and eventual excommunicate of the church quarreled endlessly with his equally outspoken counterpart nekrasov. the disputes between markov and nekrasov were not limited to mathematics and religion, they quarreled over political and philosophical issues as well."  gely p. basharin, amy n. langville, valeriy a. naumov, [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121218173228/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/meyn/www/spm_files/markov-work-and-life.pdf the life and work of a. a. markov], page 6.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=naming infinity: a true story of religious mysticism and mathematical creativity|year=2009|publisher=harvard university press|isbn=978-0-674-03293-4|author1=loren r. graham|author2=jean-michel kantor|page=69|quote=markov (1856–1922), on the other hand, was an atheist and a strong critic of the orthodox church and the tzarist government (nekrasov exaggeratedly called him a marxist).}}</ref>  [[file:literator bridges grave markov.jpg|right|thumb|alt=markov's headstone|markov's [[headstone]]]] in 1913, the council of st. petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university. markov was among them, but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education. the affirmation only occurred four years later, after the [[february revolution]] in 1917. markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in 1922.  == see also == {{div col||20em}} * [[chebyshev–markov–stieltjes inequalities]] * [[gauss–markov theorem]] * [[gauss–markov process]] * [[hidden markov model]] * [[markov blanket]] * [[markov chain]] * [[markov decision process]] * [[markov's inequality]] * [[markov information source]] * [[markov random field|markov network]] * [[markov number]] * [[markov property]] * [[markov process]] * [[stochastic matrix]] (also known as markov matrix) * [[subjunctive possibility]] {{div col end}}  == notes == {{reflist}}  == references == * {{cite book|author=karl-georg steffens|title=the history of approximation theory: from euler to bernstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijfjnoq638kc&pg=pa98|date=28 july 2007|publisher=springer science & business media|isbn=978-0-8176-4475-8|pages=98–105}} * а. а. марков.

or '''engelbert''', was a noble [[franks|frankish]] poet who was educated under [[alcuin]] and served [[charlemagne]] as a secretary, diplomat, and son-in-law. he was venerated as a [[pre-congregation]] [[saint]] and is still honored on the day of his death, 18 february.  ==life== angilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of charlemagne at the palace school in aquae grani ([[aachen]]). he was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great english scholar alcuin. when charlemagne sent his young son [[pepin of italy|pepin]] to italy as king of the [[lombards]] angilbert went along as ''primicerius palatii,'' a high administrator of the satellite court.{{sfnp|ce|1907}} as the friend and adviser of pepin, he assisted for a while in the government of italy. angilbert delivered the document on [[byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclasm]] from the frankish synod of frankfurt to [[pope adrian i]], and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794, and 796.{{sfnp|eb|1911}} at one time, he served an officer of the maritime provinces.{{sfnp|citd|1998}} he accompanied charlemagne to rome in 800{{sfnp|eb|1878}} and was one of the [[testament of charlemagne|witnesses to his will in 811]].{{sfnp|eb|1911}}  there are various traditions concerning angilbert's relationship with [[bertha, daughter of charlemagne]]. one holds that they were married,{{sfnp|eb|1878}} another that they were not.{{sfnp|citd|1998}} they had, however, at least two sons, one of whom, [[nithard]], became a notable figure in the mid-9th century.{{sfnp|eb|1911}} control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the [[middle ages]].  bertha and angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices. on the other hand, some historians have speculated that charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands; none of charlemagne's daughters were married, despite political offers of arranged marriages.  in 790, he retired to the abbey of centulum, the "monastery of st richarius" ({{lang|la|''sancti richarii monasterium''}}) at present-day [[saint-riquier]] in [[picardy]].{{sfnp|eb|1878}} elected [[abbot]] in 794,{{sfnp|eb|1878}} he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of 200 volumes.{{sfnp|ce|1907}} it was not uncommon for the [[merovingian]], [[carolingian]], or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries; the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation. angilbert, in contrast, spent a great deal rebuilding saint-riquier; when he completed it, charlemagne spent easter of the year 800 there. in keeping with carolingian policies, angilbert established a school at saint-riquier to educate the local boys.{{sfnp|ebe|2003}}  his latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family.{{sfnp|eb|1911}} charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames. charlemagne was referred to as "david", a reference to the biblical king [[david]].{{sfnp|wilmot-buxton|1922|p=93}} angilbert was nicknamed "[[homer]]" because he wrote poetry,{{sfnp|citd|1998}} and was the probable author of an [[epic poetry|epic]], of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between charlemagne and leo iii. it is a mosaic from [[virgil]], [[ovid]], [[lucan]] and [[venantius fortunatus]], composed in the manner of einhard's use of suetonius.{{sfnp|eb|1911}} of the shorter poems, besides the greeting to pippin on his return from the campaign against the [[pannonian avars|avars]] (796), an epistle to david (i.e., charlemagne) incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. the reference to bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation.{{sfnp|eb|1911}}  ==works== angilbert's poems were published by [[ernst dümmler]] in the ''[[monumenta germaniae historica]]''. for criticisms

similar origin). the word ''angst'' was introduced into english from the [[danish language|danish]], [[norwegian language|norwegian]] and [[dutch language|dutch]] word ''angst'' and the [[german

anxiety, or inner turmoil.  in german, the technical terminology of psychology and philosophy distinguishes between ''angst'' and ''furcht'' in that  ''furcht'' is a negative anticipation regarding a concrete threat, while ''angst'' is a non-directional and unmotivated emotion. in common language, however, ''angst'' is the normal word for "fear", while ''furcht'' is an elevated synonym.<ref

the meaning of the latin word ''pavor'' for "fear", the derived words differ in meaning, e.g. as in the french ''anxiété'' and ''peur''. the word ''angst'' has existed since the 8th century, from the

the term was first attributed to [[denmark|danish]] [[philosopher]] [[søren kierkegaard]] (1813&ndash;1855). in ''[[the concept of anxiety]]'' (also known as ''the concept of dread'', depending on the translation), kierkegaard used the word ''angest'' (in common danish, ''angst'', meaning "dread" or "anxiety") to describe a profound and deep-seated condition. where animals are guided solely by

existentialist [[philosopher]]s who followed, such as [[friedrich nietzsche]], [[jean-paul sartre]] and [[martin heidegger]], each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. while kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a [[religion|religious personal belief system]], later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and [[existential despair]]. [[file:marl gerdes.jpg|thumb|[[ludger gerdes]], ''angst'', 1989]]  == music == existential angst makes its appearance in classical [[musical composition]] in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include [[gustav mahler]], [[richard strauss]] (operas ''[[elektra (opera)|elektra]]'' and ''[[salome (opera)|salome]]'', [[claude-achille debussy]] (opera ''[[pelléas et mélisande (opera)|pelleas et melisande]]'', ballet ''[[jeux]]'', other works), [[jean sibelius]] (especially the fourth symphony), [[arnold schoenberg]] ''([[a survivor from warsaw]]'', other works), [[alban berg]], [[francis poulenc]] (opera ''[[dialogues of the carmelites]]''), [[dmitri shostakovich]] (opera ''[[lady macbeth of the mtsensk district (opera)|lady macbeth of the mtsensk district]]'', symphonies and chamber music), [[béla bartók]] (opera ''[[bluebeard's castle]]'', other works), and [[krzysztof penderecki]] (especially ''[[threnody to the victims of hiroshima]]'').   angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over [[cold war|international tensions]] and [[nuclear proliferation]]. [[jeff nuttall]]'s book ''[[bomb culture]]'' (1968) traced angst in popular culture to [[hiroshima]]. dread was expressed in works of [[folk rock]] such as [[bob dylan]]'s ''[[masters of war]]'' (1963) and ''[[a hard rain's a-gonna fall]]''. the term often makes an appearance in reference to [[punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[nu metal]], and works of [[emo]] where expressions of [[depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[existential despair]] or [[nihilism]] predominate.  == see also == {{div col|cols=3}} *[[anger]] *[[byronic hero]] *[[emotion]] *[[existentialism]] *[[kafkaesque]] *[[contrasting and categorization of emotions|list of emotions]] *[[thanatophobia|fear of death]] *''[[sehnsucht]]'' *[[social alienation|alienation]] *''[[sturm und drang]]'' *[[terror management theory]] *[[the mean reds (disambiguation)|the mean reds]] *''[[weltschmerz]]'' {{div col end}}  ==references== <references />  ==external links== *{{wiktionary-inline}}  {{emotion-footer}} {{søren kierkegaard}}  [[category:anxiety]] [[category:emotions]] [[category:existentialist concepts]]AnguillaMilitary | #redirect [[anguilla]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}AnguillaTransnationalissues | #redirect [[anguilla]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}Angula | {{for|the country located in africa|angola}} the word '''angula''' may refer to one of the following:  * [[aṅgula]], a measure equal to a finger's breadth * [[eel]], a biological order of fish * [[nahas angula]], former prime minister of namibia.  {{disambiguation}}AngusMcDuck | #redirect [[clan mcduck#angus "pothole" mcduck]]  {{rcat shell| {{r from fictional character|disney animated}} {{r to section}} }}Animaldisambiguation | {{wiktionary|animal}} an '''[[animal]]''' is a multicellular, eukaryotic organism of the kingdom animalia or metazoa.

[[carrot]], [[celery]] and [[parsley]] are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots, petioles and leaves, respectively. [[tomato]], [[sweet potato]] and [[bell pepper]] are tender perennials usually grown as annuals. ornamental perennials commonly grown as annuals are [[impatiens]], [[begonia|wax begonia]], [[antirrhinum|snapdragon]], ''[[pelargonium]]'', [[coleus]] and [[petunia]]. examples of true annuals include [[maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[lettuce]], [[pea]]s, [[watermelon]], [[bean]]s, [[zinnia]] and [[tagetes|marigold]].  =={{anchor|summer annuals}}summer== '''summer annuals''' sprout, flower, produce seed, and die, during the warmer months of the year.  the lawn weed [[crabgrass]] is a summer annual.  ==winter{{anchor|winter annuals}}== '''winter annuals''' germinate in autumn or winter, live through the winter, then bloom in winter or spring.  the plants grow and bloom during the cool season when most other plants are dormant or other annuals are in seed form waiting for warmer weather to germinate. winter annuals die after flowering and setting seed. the seeds germinate in the autumn or winter when the soil temperature is cool.  winter annuals typically grow low to the ground, where they are usually sheltered from the coldest nights by snow cover, and make use of warm periods in winter for growth when the snow melts. some common winter annuals include [[lamium amplexicaule|henbit]], [[deadnettle]], [[chickweed]], and [[winter cress]].[[dandelion]].  winter annuals are important ecologically, as they provide vegetative cover that prevents soil erosion during winter and early spring when no other cover exists and they provide fresh vegetation for animals and birds that feed on them. although they are often considered to be weeds in gardens, this viewpoint is not always necessary, as most of them die when the soil temperature warms up again in early to late spring when other plants are still dormant and have not yet leafed out.  even though they do not compete directly with cultivated plants, sometimes winter annuals are considered a pest in commercial agriculture, because they can be hosts for insect pests or fungal diseases (ovary smut – microbotryum sp) which attack crops being cultivated.  ironically, the property that they prevent the soil from drying out can also be problematic for commercial agriculture.  ==molecular genetics== in 2008, it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to the conversion into a [[perennial plant]].<ref>{{cite

monastery]] in picardy,.<ref name=shmi /> according to the ''[[vita ansgari]]i'' ("life of ansgar"), when the little boy learned in a vision that his mother was in the company of [[saint mary]], his careless attitude toward spiritual matters changed to seriousness ("life of ansgar", 1).  his pupil, successor, and eventual biographer [[rimbert]] considered the visions of which this was the first to be the main motivation of the saint's life.  ansgar was a product of the phase of christianization of [[duchy of saxony|saxony]] (present day [[northern germany]]) begun by [[charlemagne]] and continued by his son and successor, [[louis the pious]]. a group of monks including ansgar were sent back to [[jutland]] with the baptized exiled king [[harald klak]]. ansgar returned two years later after educating young boys who had been purchased because harald had possibly been driven out of his kingdom. in 822 ansgar was one of a number of missionaries sent to found the abbey of [[corvey]] (new corbie) in [[westphalia]], and there became a teacher and preacher. then in 829 in response to a request from the swedish king [[björn at hauge]] for a mission to the [[swedish people|swedes]], louis appointed ansgar missionary. with an assistant, the friar witmar, he preached and made converts for six months at [[birka]], on lake [[mälaren]]. they organized a small congregation there with the king's steward, hergeir, and [[mor frideborg]] as its most prominent members. in 831 he returned to louis' court at [[worms, germany|worms]] and was appointed to the [[archbishopric of bremen|archbishopric of hamburg]]. this was a new archbishopric with a see formed from those of [[archbishopric of bremen|bremen]] and [[verden, germany|verden]], plus the right to send missions into all the northern lands and to consecrate bishops for them. he was given the mission of evangelizing [[denmark]], [[norway]], and [[sweden]]. the king of sweden decided to cast lots as to whether the christian missionaries should be admitted into his kingdom. ansgar recommended the issue to the care of god, and the lot was favorable.<ref name=shmi />  ansgar was consecrated in november 831, and, the arrangements having been at once approved by [[pope gregory iv|gregory iv]], he went to rome to receive the [[pallium]] directly from the hands of the pope and to be named legate for the northern lands. this commission had previously been bestowed upon [[ebbo, archbishop of reims]], but the jurisdiction was divided by agreement, with ebbo retaining sweden for himself. for a time ansgar devoted himself to the needs of his own diocese, which was still missionary territory with but a few churches. he founded a monastery and a school in hamburg; the school was intended to serve the danish mission, but accomplished little.  after [[louis the pious|louis]] died in 840, his empire was divided and ansgar lost the abbey of [[torhout|turholt]], which had been given as an endowment for his work. then in 845, the [[danes]] unexpectedly raided hamburg, destroying all the church's treasures and books and leaving the entire diocese unrestorable.  ansgar now had neither see nor revenue. many of his helpers deserted him, but the new king, [[louis the german]], came to his aid; after failing to recover turholt for him, in 847 he awarded him the vacant diocese of bremen, where he took up residence in 848. however, since hamburg had been an archbishopric, the sees of bremen and hamburg were combined for him. this presented canonical difficulties and also aroused the anger of the bishop of cologne, to whom bremen had been [[suffragan]], but after prolonged negotiations, [[pope nicholas i]] approved the union of the two dioceses in 864.  through all this political turmoil, ansgar continued his mission to the northern lands. the danish civil war compelled him to establish good relations with two kings, [[horik i|horik the elder]] and his son, [[horik ii]]. both assisted him until his death (wood, 124–125). he was able to secure recognition of christianity as a tolerated religion and permission to build a church in [[sleswick]]. he did not forget the swedish mission, and spent two years there in person (848–850), at the critical moment when a pagan reaction was threatened, which he succeeded in averting. in 854, ansgar returned to sweden when king [[olof (i) of sweden|olof]] ruled in birka. according to rimbert, he was well disposed to christianity. on a viking raid to [[apuole]] (current village in [[lithuania]]) in [[courland]], the swedes plundered the [[curonians]].  ansgar wore a rough hair shirt, lived on bread and water, and showed great charity to the poor. being the first missionary in sweden and the organiser of the hierarchy in the [[nordic countries]], he was declared patron of [[scandinavia]].<ref name=shmi /> ansgar was buried in [[bremen (city)|bremen]] in 865.  his life story was written by his successor as archbishop, [[rimbert]], in the ''[[vita ansgari]]i''.  == relics == relics are located in [[hamburg]] on two places: st. mary's cathedral (germ.: domkirche st. marien) and st. ansgar's and st. bernard's church (germ.: st. ansgar und st. bernhard kirche).  ==visions== [[file:erzbischof ansgar 01 kmj.jpg|thumb|upright|saint ansgar statue in hamburg]] although a historical document and primary source written by a man whose existence can be proven historically, the ''[[vita ansgari]]i'' ("the life of ansgar") aims above all to demonstrate ansgar's sanctity. it is partly concerned with ansgar's visions, which, according to the author rimbert, encouraged and assisted ansgar's remarkable missionary feats.  through the course of this work, ansgar repeatedly embarks on a new stage in his career following a vision.  according to rimbert, his early studies and ensuing devotion to the ascetic life of a monk were inspired by a vision of his mother in the presence of saint mary.  again, when the swedish people were left without a priest for some time, he begged king horik to help him with this problem; then after receiving his consent, consulted with bishop gautbert to find a suitable man. the two together sought the approval of king louis, which he granted when he learned that they were in agreement on the issue. ansgar was convinced he was commanded by heaven to undertake this mission, and was influenced by a vision he received when he was concerned about the journey, in which he met a man who reassured him of his purpose and informed him of a prophet that he would meet, the [[abbot]] [[adalard of corbie|adalhard]], who would instruct him in what was to happen.  in the vision, he searched for and found adalhard, who commanded, "islands, listen to me, pay attention, remotest peoples", which ansgar interpreted as god's will that he go to the scandinavian countries as "most of that country consisted of islands, and also, when 'i will make you the light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth' was added, since the end of the world in the north was in swedish territory".<ref name=rimbert>{{cite web|first=rimbert|title=life of anskar, the

a real or apparent mutual incompatibility of two laws.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/antinomy antinomy], encyclopædia britannica online, accessed 8/27/2016</ref> it is a term used in [[logic]] and [[epistemology]], particularly in the philosophy of [[kant]] and [[roberto mangabeira unger|roberto unger]].  there are many examples of antinomy. a self-contradictory phrase such as "there is no absolute truth" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement. a [[paradox]] such as "[[this sentence is false]]" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa.  ==kant's use== {{see|kant's antinomies}} the term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of [[immanuel kant]] (1724–1804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason that are proper to the universe of sensible perception or [[experience]] (phenomena).<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=antinomy|volume=2|page=130}}</ref> [[empirical]] reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcends]] it.  for kant there are [[kant's antinomies|four antinomies]],<ref>s. al-azm, the origins of kant's argument in the antinomies, oxford university press 1972.</ref><ref>m. grier, kant's doctrine of transcendental illusion, cambridge university press 2001.</ref><ref>m. grier, "the logic of illusion and the antinomies," in bird (ed.), blackwell, oxford 2006, pp. 192-207.</ref> connected with: *the limitation of the universe in respect to [[space]] and [[time]] *the theory that the whole consists of indivisible [[atom]]s (whereas, in fact, none such exist) *the problem of [[free will]] in relation to universal [[causality]] *the existence of a necessary being<ref name="eb1911"/>  in each antinomy, a thesis is contradicted by an antithesis. for example: in the first antinomy, kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. this is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by "successive synthesis"—yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been "empty time" out of which time arose. this is incoherent (for kant) for the following reason: since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.  this was part of kant's critical program of determining limits to [[science]] and philosophical inquiry. these contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of any perception of it (this has to do with the distinction between [[phenomena]] and [[noumena]]). kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims are and are not justified, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.  ==see also== {{portal|logic}} ;mutual incompatibility *law: **[[alternative pleading]] *logic: **[[mutual exclusivity]] **[[kettle logic]]

buried.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06030a.htm catholic encyclopedia: ''felix ii'']</ref> however, a more recent source says that of the martyr felix nothing is known except his name, that he

encyclopedia remarked that "the real story of the antipope was lost and he obtained in local roman history the status of a saint and a confessor. as such he appears in the roman martyrology on 29 july." at that time (1909) the roman martyrology had the following text: {{quote|at rome, on the aurelian way, st. felix ii, pope and martyr. being expelled from his see by the arian emperor constantius for defending the catholic faith, and being put to the sword privately at cera in tuscany, he died gloriously. his body was taken away from that place by clerics, and buried on the

diabelli.jpg|210px|thumb|anton diabelli, lithograph by [[josef kriehuber]]]]  '''anton''' (or '''antonio''') '''diabelli''' (5 september 1781{{spaced ndash}}7 april 1858) was an [[austria]]n [[music]] publisher, editor and [[composer]]. best known in his time as a publisher, he is most familiar today as the composer of the [[waltz]] on which [[ludwig van beethoven]] wrote his set of thirty-three ''[[diabelli variations]]''.<ref name="allmusic.com">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/anton-diabelli-q1666/biography allmusic.com]</ref>  ==early life== diabelli was born in [[mattsee]] near [[salzburg]], then in the [[archbishopric of salzburg]]. a musical child, he sang in the [[boys' choir]] at [[salzburg cathedral]] where he is believed to have taken music lessons with [[michael haydn]]. by the age of 19 diabelli had already composed several important compositions including six masses.  diabelli was trained to enter the [[priest]]hood and in 1800 joined the monastery at raitenhaslach, [[electorate of bavaria|bavaria]].<ref name="allmusic.com"/> he remained there until 1803, when bavaria closed all its monasteries.  ==career== in 1803 diabelli moved to [[vienna]] and began teaching [[piano]] and [[classical guitar|guitar]] and found work as a proofreader for a music publisher. during this period he learned the music publishing business while continuing to compose. in 1809 he composed his comic opera, ''adam in der klemme.'' in 1817 he started a music publishing business and in 1818 he formed a partnership with [[pietro cappi]] to create the music publishing firm of cappi & diabelli.  cappi & diabelli became well known by [[arrangement|arranging]] popular pieces so they could be played by amateurs at home. a master of promotion, diabelli selected widely-accessible music such as famous opera tune arrangements, dance music and popular new comic theatre songs.  the firm soon established a reputation in more serious music circles by championing the works of [[franz schubert]]. diabelli recognized the composer's potential and became the first to publish schubert's work with "[[der erlkönig]]" in 1821. diabelli's firm continued to publish schubert's work until 1823 when an argument between cappi and schubert terminated their business. the following year diabelli and cappi parted ways, diabelli launching a new publishing house, diabelli & co., in 1824. following schubert's early death in 1828 diabelli purchased a large portion of the composer's massive musical estate from schubert's brother [[ferdinand schubert|ferdinand]]. as schubert had hundreds of unpublished works, diabelli's firm was able to publish "new" schubert works for more than 30 years after the composer's death.  diabelli's publishing house expanded throughout his life, before he retired in 1851, leaving it under the control of [[carl anton spina]]. when diabelli died in 1858 spina continued to run the firm and published much music by [[johann strauss ii]] and [[josef strauss]]. in 1872 the firm was taken over by [[friedrich schreiber]] and in 1876 it merged with the firm of [[august cranz]] who bought the company in 1879 and ran it under his name.  diabelli died in vienna at the age of 76.  ==compositions== {{main article|list of compositions by anton diabelli}} diabelli produced a number of well-known works as a composer, including an [[operetta]] called ''adam in der klemme'', several [[mass (music)|mass]]es, [[song]]s and numerous piano and classical guitar pieces. numerically his guitar pieces form the largest part of his works. his pieces for [[piano four hands]] are popular.  diabelli's composition ''pleasures of youth: six sonatinas'' is a collection of six [[sonatina]]s depicting a struggle between unknown opposing forces. this is suggested by the sharp and frequent change in dynamics from ''[[dynamics (music)|forte]]'' to ''[[dynamics (music)|piano]]''. when ''forte'' is indicated the pianist is meant to evoke a sense of wickedness, thus depicting the antagonist. in contrast the markings of ''piano'' represent the protagonist.  ===diabelli variations=== {{listen|filename=beethoven - diabelli variations - 00.ogg|title=diabelli's theme|description=performed by neal o'doan}} the composition for which diabelli is now best known was actually written as part of an adventuring story. in 1819, as a promotional idea, he decided to try to publish a volume of [[variation (music)|variation]]s on a "patriotic" waltz he had penned expressly for this purpose, with one variation by every important austrian composer living at the time, as well as several significant non-austrians. the combined contributions would be published in an anthology called ''[[vaterländischer künstlerverein]]''. fifty-one composers responded with pieces, including beethoven, schubert, archduke rudolph of austria, f.x. wolfgang mozart (jun.), moritz count von dietrichstein, heinrich eduard josef baron von lannoy, ignaz franz baron von mosel, [[carl czerny]], [[johann nepomuk hummel]], [[ignaz moscheles]], and the eight-year-old [[franz liszt]] (although it seems liszt was not invited personally, but his teacher czerny arranged for him to be involved). czerny was also enlisted to write a [[coda (music)|coda]]. beethoven, however, instead of providing just one variation, provided 33, and his formed part i of ''vaterländischer künstlerverein''. they constitute what is generally regarded as one of the greatest of beethoven's piano pieces and as the greatest set of variations of their time, and are generally known simply as the ''[[diabelli variations]]'', op. 120. the other 50 variations were published as part ii of ''vaterländischer künstlerverein''.  ==cultural references== a [[sonatina]] of diabelli's, presumably sonatina in f major, op. 168, no. 1 (i: moderato cantabile), provides the title and a motif for the french [[novella]] ''[[moderato cantabile]]'' by [[marguerite duras]].  ==see

had a human mind; rather,  jesus had a [[human]] body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a [[god|divine]] mind.   the [[trinity]] had been recognized at the council of nicea in 325, but debate about exactly what it meant continued. a rival to the more common belief that jesus christ had two natures was [[monophysitism]] ("one nature"), the doctrine that christ had only one nature. apollinarism and [[eutychianism]] were two forms of monophysitism. apollinaris' rejection that christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to [[arianism]] and its teaching that christ was not divine.<ref>mcgrath, alister. 1998. ''historical theology, an introduction to the history of christian thought.'' oxford: blackwell publishers. chapter 1.</ref>  [[theodoret]] charged apollinaris with confounding the persons of the [[godhead (christianity)|godhead]] and with giving in to the heretical ways of [[sabellius]]. [[basil of caesarea]] accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. his views were condemned in a [[synod]] at [[alexandria]], under [[athanasius of alexandria]], in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the [[polemian]]s and the [[antidicomarianite]]s.  it was declared to be a [[christian heresy|heresy]] in 381 by the [[first council of constantinople]], since christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully god. followers of apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a [[tertium quid]] ("third thing," neither god nor man).  apollinaris further taught, following [[tertullian]], that the [[soul (spirit)|soul]]s of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies (see [[traducianism]]). {{citation needed|date=october 2010}}  christian philosopher [[william lane craig]] has proposed a neo-apollinarian christology in which the divine logos completes the human nature of christ. craig says his proposal is tentative and he welcomes critique and interaction from other scholars.<ref>william lane craig and j.p. moreland. 2003.

[[priscilla and aquila]], a jewish christian couple who had come to ephesus with the [[paul the apostle|apostle paul]], instructed apollos:  :"when priscilla and aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of god more adequately."{{bibleref2c|acts|18:26}}  the differences between the two understandings probably related to [[baptism with the holy spirit]], since apollos "knew only the baptism of john". later, during apollos' absence, the writer of the [[acts of the apostles]] recounts an encounter between paul and some disciples at ephesus: {{quote|and he said to them, "did you receive the holy spirit when you believed?" and they said, "no, we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit." and he said, "into what then were you baptized?" they said, "into john's baptism." and paul said, "john baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, jesus." 5 on hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus. and when paul had laid his hands on them, the holy spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. {{bibleref|acts|19:2-6}}}}  before paul's arrival, apollos had moved from ephesus to [[achaia (roman province)|achaia]]{{bibleref2c|acts|18:27}} <ref>so the [[alexandrian text-type|alexandrian recension]]; the text in [[papyrus 38|<math>\mathfrak{p}</math><sup>38</sup>]] and [[codex bezae]] indicate that apollos went to corinth. joseph fitzmyer, ''the acts of the apostles'' (new york: doubleday, 1998), p. 639.</ref> and was living in [[corinth]], the provincial capital of achaia.{{bibleref2c|acts|19:1}} acts reports that apollos arrived in achaia with a [[epistle to corinth|letter of recommendation]] from the ephesian christians and "greatly helped those who through grace had believed, for he powerfully refuted the jews in public, showing by the [[old testament|scriptures]] that the christ was jesus ({{bibleref2|acts|18:27-28}}).  ===1 corinthians=== paul's [[first epistle to the corinthians]] (55 ad) mentions apollos as an important figure at corinth. paul describes apollos' role at corinth: :''i planted, apollos watered, but god gave the growth.'' ({{bibleref2|1 cor|3:6}}) paul's epistle refers to a [[schism (religion)|schism]] between four parties in the corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to paul and apollos respectively, using their names (the third and fourth were peter, identified as cephas, and jesus christ himself).{{bibleref2c|1 cor|1:10-13}} it is possible, though, that, as msgr. [[ronald knox]] suggests, the parties were actually two, one claiming to follow paul, the other claiming to follow apollos. "it is surely probable that the adherents of st. paul [...] alleged in defence of his orthodoxy the fact that he was in full agreement with, and in some sense commissioned by, the apostolic college. hence 'i am for cephas'. [...] what reply was the faction of apollos to make? it devised an expedient which has been imitated by sectaries more than once in later times; appealed behind the apostolic college itself to him from whom the apostolic college derived its dignity; 'i am for christ.'"<ref>knox, r.

some cases, an applet does not run independently. these applets must run either in a [[container (data structure)|container]] provided by a host program, through a [[plug-in (computing)|plugin]], or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model.  === web-based applets === applets are used to provide interactive features to web applications that cannot be provided by [[html]] alone. they can capture [[mouse (computing)|mouse input]] and also have controls like [[button (computing)|buttons]] or [[check box]]es. in response to the user action an applet can change the provided graphic content. this makes applets well suitable for demonstration, visualization, and teaching. there are online applet collections for studying various subjects, from physics<ref>[http://www.falstad.com/mathphysics.html paul falstad online applet portal]</ref> to heart physiology.<ref name='hear'>[http://thevirtualheart.org/capindex.html the virtual hearth]</ref> applets are also used to create online game collections that allow players to compete against live opponents in real-time.  an applet can also be a text area only, providing, for instance, a cross platform [[command-line interface]] to some remote system.<ref>[http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/ jraft.com]</ref> if needed, an applet can leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window. however, applets have very little control over web page content outside the applet dedicated area, so they are less useful for improving the site appearance in general (while applets like [[news ticker]]s<ref>[http://www.objectplanet.com/newsticker/ objectplanet.com], an applet that works as news ticker</ref> or [[wysiwyg]] editors<ref>[http://www.sferyx.com/ sferyx.com], a company that produces applets acting as [[wyswyg]] editor.</ref> are also known). applets can also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser<ref>[[cortado (software)|cortado applet to play ogg format]]</ref>  html pages may embed parameters that are passed to the applet. hence the same applet may appear differently depending on the parameters that were passed.  examples of web-based applets include:{{citation needed|date=august 2012}}  * [[quicktime|quicktime movies]] * [[swf|flash movies]] * [[windows media player]] applets, used to display embedded video files in [[internet explorer]] (and other [[web browser|browsers]] that support the plugin) * [[3d modeling]] display applets, used to rotate and zoom a model * [[browser game]]s can be applet-based, though some may develop into fully functional applications that require installation.  ===applet vs. subroutine=== a larger application distinguishes its applets through several features:{{citation needed|date=july 2009}}  * applets execute only on the "client" platform environment of a system, as contrasted from "[[java servlet|servlet]]". as such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser). * the container restricts applets' capabilities. * applets are written in a language different from the scripting or [[html]] language that invokes it. the applet is written in a compiled language, whereas the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence the greater performance or functionality of the applet. unlike a subroutine, a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.  ==java applet== {{main|java applet}}  a java applet is a java program that is launched from html and run in a web browser. it can provide web applications with interactive features that cannot be provided by [[html]]. since java's [[bytecode]] is platform-independent, java applets can be executed by browsers running under many platforms, including [[microsoft windows|windows]], [[unix]], [[macos]], and [[linux]]. when a java technology-enabled [[web browser]] processes a page that contains an applet, the applet's [[code]] is transferred to the client's system and executed by the browser's [[java virtual machine]] (jvm).<ref>[http://java.sun.com/applets/ "applets"], sun developer network. accessed on july 21, 2009</ref> an html page references an applet either via the [[deprecation|deprecated]] [[html element#applet|<applet> tag]] or via its replacement, the [[html element#object|<object> tag]].<ref>[http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_applet.asp "html applet tag"], w3schools. access on july 21, 2009 </ref>  ==security== recent developments in the coding of applications including mobile and [[embedded system]]s have led to the awareness  of the security of applets.  ===open platform applets=== applets in an [[open platform]] environment should provide secure interactions between different applications. a compositional approach can be used to provide security for [[open platform]] applets.<ref name="compositional">{{cite web |title=compositional

===java applets=== a [[java applet]] contains different security models:  [[java applet#unsigned|unsigned java applet security]], [[java applet#signed|signed java applet security]], and [[java applet#self-signed|self signed java applet security]].  ===web-based applets=== in an applet-enabled [[web browser]], many methods can be used to provide applet security for malicious applets. a

[[cook strait]]'s narrowest point is between arapaoa island's perano head and [[cape terawhiti]] in the north island.  ==history== according to [[māori mythology|māori oral tradition]], the island was where the great navigator [[kupe]] killed the octopus [[te wheke-a-muturangi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theprow.org.nz/maori/geographic-names-tetauihu/ |title=new and altered geographic names of te tau ihu |year=2014 |website=theprow.org.nz |publisher= |accessdate=7 november 2015}}</ref>  it was from a hill on arapaoa island in 1770 that captain [[james cook]] first saw the sea passage from the [[pacific ocean]] to the [[tasman sea]], which was named [[cook strait]].  this discovery banished the fond notion of geographers that there existed a great southern continent, [[terra australis]].  a monument at cook's lookout was erected in 1970.  from the late 1820s until the mid-1960s, arapaoa island was a base for [[whaling]] in the sounds. [[john guard]] established a shore station at te awaiti in 1827 for [[right whales]]. later, the station at perano head on the east coast of the island was used to hunt [[humpback whales]] from 1911 to 1964 (see [[whaling in new zealand]]). the houses built by the perano family are now operated as tourist accommodations.  in august 2014, the spelling of the island's name was officially altered

introduced by the early whalers, or by captain cook or other early explorers.  these breeds are now extinct in england, and the goats surviving in a sanctuary on the island are now also bred in other

and is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. it also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.  the system came with two [[intellivision]]-style controllers with a 12 button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. the direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. most games came with [[bopet]] overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. the console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.  there are at least three different types of cartridge case styles<ref>[http://www.obsoletemedia.org/emerson-arcadia-2001/ obsoletemedia.org: emerson arcadia 2001 (1982 – 1984)]</ref> and artwork, with variations on each. emerson-family

{{lang-el|{{lang|grc|ἀρκάδιος}}}}; 1 january 377 – 1 may 408) was [[byzantine emperor]] from 383 to 408. he was the eldest son of [[theodosius i]] and his first wife [[aelia flaccilla]], and brother of the western emperor [[honorius (emperor)|honorius]]. a weak ruler, his reign was dominated by a series of powerful ministers and by his wife, [[aelia eudoxia]].{{citation needed|date=july 2012}}  ==history== arcadius was born in [[hispania]], the elder son of [[theodosius i]] and [[aelia flaccilla]], and brother of [[flavius augustus honorius|honorius]], who would become a [[western roman emperor]]. his father declared him an [[augustus_(honorific)|augustus]] and co-ruler for the [[byzantine empire|eastern half of the empire]] in january 383. his younger brother was also declared augustus in 393, for the western half.  as emperors, honorius was under the control of the romanized vandal ''[[magister militum]]'' [[stilicho|flavius stilicho]] while arcadius was dominated by one of his ministers, [[rufinus (consul)|rufinus]]. stilicho is alleged by some to have wanted control of both emperors, and is supposed to have had rufinus assassinated by gothic mercenaries in 395; though definite proof of stilicho's involvement in the assassination is lacking, the intense competition and political jealousies engendered by the two figures compose the main thread of the first part of arcadius' reign. arcadius' new advisor, the eunuch [[eutropius (consul)|eutropius]], simply took rufinus' place as the power behind the eastern imperial throne.  arcadius was also dominated by his wife [[aelia eudoxia]], who convinced her husband to dismiss eutropius, who was holding the consulate, at the height of his power, in 399. that same year, on 13 july, arcadius issued an edict ordering that [[persecution of religion in ancient rome|all remaining non-christian temples should be immediately demolished]].  eudoxia's influence was strongly opposed by [[john chrysostom]], the [[patriarch of constantinople]], who felt that she had used her family's wealth to gain control over the emperor. eudoxia used her influence to have chrysostom deposed in 404, but she died later that year. eudoxia gave to arcadius four children: three daughters, [[pulcheria]], [[arcadia (daughter of arcadius)|arcadia]] and marina, and one son, theodosius, the future emperor [[theodosius ii]].  arcadius was dominated for the rest of his rule by [[anthemius (praetorian prefect)|anthemius]], the [[praetorian prefect|praetorian prefect]], who made peace with stilicho in the west.  arcadius

(irish tv series)|who do you think you are?]]'' which aired on 6 october 2008 revealed that o'hanlon's paternal grandfather, michael o'hanlon, was a [[university college dublin|ucd]] medicine student who had joined the [[irish republican army (1917–22)|ira]] during the [[irish war of independence]] and was a member of [[michael collins (irish leader)|michael collins]]' squad which assassinated british secret service agents on the morning of [[bloody sunday (1920)|bloody sunday]]. details of his grandfather's activities survive in ucd archives, as well as [[blackrock college]]. it also transpired that, on his mother's side, he is a close relative of [[peter fenelon collier]].  o'hanlon was schooled in [[blackrock college]] in dublin and graduated, in 1987, from the [[national institute for higher education]], [[dublin]] (now [[dublin city university]]) with a degree in communications studies.  ==career== together with kevin gildea and barry murphy, o'hanlon founded the international comedy cellar, upstairs in the international bar on dublin's south wicklow street. dublin had no comedy scene at the time. as a stand up, o'hanlon won the [[hackney empire new act of the year]] competition in 1994. for a time he was the presenter of ''the stand up show''.  he was spotted by [[graham linehan]], who was to cast him as father dougal mcguire in ''[[father ted]]'' (1995–98). in 1995 he received the top tv comedy newcomer at the british comedy awards for this role. in 1995, he appeared (as father dougal) in a [[channel 4]] [[television ident|ident]] ("hello, you're watching.... television"), and during [[comic relief (charity)|comic relief]] on bbc1. this was followed by the award-winning short comedy film ''[[flying saucer rock'n'roll]]''.  o'hanlon moved into straight acting alongside [[emma fielding]] and [[beth goddard]] in the [[itv (tv network)|itv]] comedy-drama ''big bad world'', which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. he also played a minor role in ''[[the butcher boy (1997 film)|the butcher boy]]'' as joe's (francie's best friend) father, and appeared in an episode of the original ''[[whose line is it anyway?

at one point, he says, "what is argot; properly speaking? argot is the language of misery."  the earliest known record of the term ''argot'' in this context was in a 1628 document. the word was probably derived from the contemporary name ''les argotiers'', given to a group of thieves at that time.<ref>guiraud, pierre, ''l'argot. que sais-je?'', paris: puf, 1958, p. 700</ref>  under the strictest definition, an ''argot'' is a proper language with its own grammar and style. but such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; ''argot'' used in this [[word sense|sense]] is [[synonym]]ous with ''[[cant (language)|cant]]''. for example, ''argot'' in this sense is used for systems such as ''[[verlan]]'' and ''[[louchébem]]'', which retain french syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words).<ref name="valdman">{{cite journal  | last = valdman  | first = albert  | title = la langue des faubourgs et des banlieues: de l'argot au français populaire  | journal = the french review  | volume = 73  | issue = 6  | pages = 1179–1192  | publisher = american association of teachers of french  | date = may 2000  | jstor = 399371|language=fr}}</ref> such systems are examples of ''argots à clef'', or "coded argots."<ref name="valdman"/>  specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way. for example, modern [[french language|french]] ''[[wikt:loufoque|loufoque]]'' 'crazy, goofy', now common usage, originates in the ''[[louchébem]]'' transformation of fr.

the [[defendant]] to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her. in response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. acceptable pleas vary among jurisdiction but they generally include "guilty", "not guilty", and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. pleas of "[[nolo contendere]]" (no contest) and the "[[alford plea|''alford'' plea]]" are allowed in some circumstances.  == australia ==  in australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]]. the judge will testify during the indictment process.  == canada ==  in every province in canada except british columbia, defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial.  in british columbia, arraignment takes places in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer. the defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.  == france ==  in france, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest.<ref name=fti-france>{{cite web|title=criminal proceedings and defence rights in france|publisher=[[fair trials international]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/france-advice-note.pdf}}</ref> however, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime.<ref name=fti-france/> the police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor (in the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent).<ref name=fti-france/>  == germany ==  in germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.<ref name=fti-germany>{{cite web|title=criminal proceedings and defence rights in germany|publisher=[[fair trials international]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/germany-advice-note.pdf}}</ref>  == new zealand ==  at the first appearance, the accused is read the charges and asked for a plea. the available pleas are, guilty, not guilty, and no plea.  no plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea, which must be made on the second appearance.<ref>http://www.howtolaw.co/facing-criminal-charges-392160</ref>  == south africa ==  in south africa, arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear, the informing of the accused of the crime charged against him, the demanding of the accused whether he be guilty or not guilty, and the entering of his plea. his plea having been entered he is said to stand arraigned.  == united kingdom ==  in england, wales, and [[northern ireland]], arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]].  in england and wales, the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than 24 hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent (or above) authorises detention for a further 12 hours (36 hours total), or a judge (who will be a magistrate) authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of 96 hours, but for terrorism-related offences people can be held by the police for up to 28 days before charge.<ref name=fti-england-wales>{{cite web|title=criminal proceedings and defence rights in england and wales|publisher=[[fair trials international]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/criminal-proceedings-and-defence-rights-in-england-and-wales-aug-2013.pdf}}</ref> if they are not released after being charged, they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable.<ref name=fti-england-wales/>  == united states ==  under the united states [[federal rules of criminal procedure]], "arraignment shall [consist of an] open...reading [of] the [[indictment]]...to the defendant...and call[] on him to plead thereto. he/she shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he/she is called upon to plead."<ref>{{frcrp|10}}</ref>  in federal courts, arraignment takes place in two stages. the first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until monday.<ref>{{cite book |title=criminal procedure |publisher=thomson wadsworth |year=2012 |edition=8th |first=joel |last=samaha |isbn=978-0-495-91335-1 }}</ref> during this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. the presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set [[bail]]. during the second arraignment, a post-indictment arraignment or pia, the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.  in new york, most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours.<ref>{{cite news|title=ruling forces new york to release or arraign suspects in 24 hours|first=kevin|last=sack|work=[[the new

thus, an individual arrested without a warrant, in some cases, may be held for as long as 168 hours (7 days) without arraignment or charge.<ref name=riverside/>  ==form of the arraignment== the wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.<ref>in some jurisdictions the wording of the arraignment is set by statute or court practice direction.</ref>  however, it generally conforms with the following principles: # the accused person ([[defendant]]) is addressed by [[name]]; # the [[criminal charge|charge]] against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offense (and sometimes the names of the state's witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge(s)); and, # the accused person is asked formally how he or she [[plea]]ds.  ==video arraignment== '''video arraignment''' is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of [[videoconferencing]] technology. use of video arraignment system allows the [[court]]s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the [[courtroom]] by using an [[audio-visual]] link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.  use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. the transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. it also addresses the rising costs of transportation.  ==guilty and not-guilty pleas== if the defendant pleads guilty, an [[preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. the court is not required to accept a guilty plea. during the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character, and passes [[sentence (law)|sentence]].  if the defendant pleads [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]], a date is set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or a [[trial]].  in the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or "stood mute") was subject to [[peine forte et dure]] ([[law french]] for "strong and hard punishment"). today in [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.<ref>in queensland, australia, this matter is covered by statute. see s601 of the queensland [[criminal code]].</ref> the rationale for this is the defendant's [[right to silence]].  ==pre-trial release== this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.  ==see also== *[[desk appearance ticket]]  ==references== {{reflist}}

1990 by [[j-ax]] and [[dj jad]], melting [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], pop and traditional italian musical forms. they are one of the most popular italian hip hop groups.  ==band history== articolo 31 were formed by rapper [[j-ax]] (real name alessandro aleotti) and dj jad (vito luca perrini). in the spoken intro of ''[[strade di città]]'' ("city streets"), it is stated that the band is named after the article of the [[irish constitution]] guaranteeing freedom of the press, although it must be noted that article 31 of the irish constitution is not about the freedom of the press. they probably meant the [[censorship_in_the_republic_of_ireland#the_troubles|section 31 of the broadcasting authority act]].  '''articolo 31''' released one of the first italian hip hop records, ''strade di città'', in 1993. soon, they signed with [[bertelsmann music group|bmg ricordi]] and started to mix rap with pop music - a move that earned them great commercial success but that alienated the underground hip hop scene, who perceived them as traitors. in 1997, [[dj gruff]] dissed articolo 31 in a track titled ''1 vs 2'' on the first album of the beatmaker fritz da cat,  starting a feud that would go on for years.   in 2001, articolo 31 collaborated with the american [[old school hip hop|old school]] rapper [[kurtis blow]] on the album ''xché si!''. in the same year, they made the movie ''[[senza filtro]]'' (in english, ''"[[without filter]]"''). their producer was [[franco godi]], who also produced the music for the ''signor rossi'' animated series.  their 2002 album ''domani smetto'' represented a further departure from hip hop, increasingly relying on the formula of rapping over pop music samples.  following their 2003 album "italiano medio", the band took a break. both j ax and dj jad have been involved with solo projects. in 2006, the group declared an indefinite [[recess (break)|hiatus]].  their posse, ''[[spaghetti funk]]'', includes other popular performers like space one and pop rappers [[gemelli diversi]].  ==band members== *[[j-ax]] -

league system.  the club has ties with former [[association football]] club [[alumni athletic club|alumni]] because both were established by [[buenos aires english high school]] students.  ==history== ===background=== {{main|alumni athletic club}} the first club with the name "alumni" played [[association football]], having been found in 1898 by students of [[buenos aires english high school]] (baehs) along with director [[alexander watson hutton]]. originally under the name "english high school a.c.", the team would be later obliged by the [[argentine football association|association]] to change its name, therefore "alumni" was chosen, following a proposal by carlos bowers, a former student of the school.  alumni was the most successful team during the first years of argentine football, winning 10 of 14 [[argentine primera división|league championships]] contested. alumni is still considered the first great football team in the country.<ref name=clarin>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/04/24/d-549894.htm "en el nombre del fútbol", ''[[clarín (argentine newspaper)|clarín]]'' newspaper, 2003-04-24]</ref> alumni was reorganised in 1908, "in order to encourage people to practise all kind of sports, specially football". this was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just a football team, such as lomas, belgrano and [[quilmes atlético club|quilmes]] had successfully done in the past, but the efforts were not enough. alumni played its last game in [[1911 in argentine football|1911]] and was definitely dissolved on april 24, 1913.  ===rebirth through rugby=== in 1951 a group of baehs students asked school's alumni for permission to re-establish the name "alumni" for a rugby union team. this request was immediately approved in a meeting presided by carlos bowers, who had proposed the name "alumni" to the original football team 50 years before.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121108143046/http://www.asociacionalumni.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6&itemid=71 "los comienzos de alumni" - club's official website] (archive, 8 nov 2012)</ref>  the team achieved good results and in 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the [[unión de rugby de buenos aires|buenos aires league]], reaching the second division. since then, alumni has played at the highest level of argentine rugby and its rivalry with [[belgrano athletic club]] is one of the fiercest [[local derby|local derbies]] in [[buenos aires]]. alumni would later climb up to first division winning 5 titles: 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and the other in 2001.  in 2002, alumni won its first [[nacional de clubes]] title, defeating [[jockey club de rosario]] 23-21 in the final.  ==honours== *'''[[nacional de clubes]] (1)''': 2002 *'''[[torneo de la urba]] (5)''': 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 2001  ==see also== *

[[synapomorphies]] (a character that is shared by two or more groups through evolutionary development) include the presence in the plants of [[oligosaccharide]] [[inulin]], a nutrient storage molecule used instead of [[starch]]; and unique [[stamen]] morphology. the stamens are usually found around the [[gynoecium|style]], either aggregated densely or fused into a tube, probably an [[adaptation]] in association with the plunger (brush; or secondary) [[pollination]] that is common among the families of the order, wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil.  == taxonomy == the name and order asterales is botanically venerable, dating back to at least 1926 in the [[hutchinson system| hutchinson system of plant taxonomy]] when it contained only five families, of which only two are retained in the apg iii classification. under the [[cronquist system]] of taxonomic classification of flowering plants, [[asteraceae]] was the only family in the group, but newer systems (such as [[apg ii system|apg ii]] and [[apg iii system|apg iii]]) have expanded it to 11. in the classification system of [[rolf dahlgren|dahlgren]] the asterales were in the [[superorder]] asteriflorae (also called asteranae).   the order '''asterales''' currently includes 11 families, the largest of which are the [[asteraceae]], with about 25,000 species, and the [[campanulaceae]] ("bellflowers"), with about 2,000 species. the remaining families count together for less than 500 species. the two large families are cosmopolitan, with many of their species found in the northern hemisphere, and the smaller families are usually confined to australia and the adjacent areas, or sometimes south america.  only the asteraceae have composite flower heads; the other families do not, but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the 11 families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the [[rosids]].  the phylogenetic tree according to apg iii for the campanulid clade is as below.<ref name=apweb>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobot.org/mobot/research/apweb/ |title=angiosperm phylogeny website |publisher=mobot.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>  {{clade |label1=[[campanulids|campanulid&nbsp;clade&nbsp;]]&nbsp;(similar&nbsp;to '''euasterids&nbsp;ii'''&nbsp;in&nbsp;apg&nbsp;ii) |1={{clade               |1=&nbsp;[[aquifoliales]]               |2={{clade                  |1={{clade                     |1=&nbsp;[[bruniales]]                     |2={{clade                        |1={{clade                           |1=&nbsp;[[paracryphiales]]                           |2=&nbsp;[[dipsacales]]                           }}                        |2=&nbsp;[[apiales]]                        }}                     }}                  |2=&nbsp;[[escalloniales]]                  |3=&nbsp;'''asterales'''                  }}               }} }}  ==biogeography== the core asterales are stylidiaceae (six [[genus|genera]]), apa [[clade]] (alseuosmiaceae, phellinaceae and argophyllaceae, together 7 genera), mgca clade (menyanthaceae, goodeniaceae, calyceraceae, in total twenty genera), and asteraceae (about sixteen hundred genera). other asterales are rousseaceae (four genera), campanulaceae (eighty four genera) and pentaphragmataceae (one genus).  all asterales families are represented in the southern hemisphere;

2007) was a norwegian [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[analytic number theory]], and in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s, in particular bringing them into relation with [[spectral theory]]. he was awarded the [[fields medal]] in 1950.  == early years == selberg was born in [[langesund]], norway, the son of teacher anna kristina selberg and mathematician [[ole michael ludvigsen selberg]]. two of his brothers also went on to become mathematicians as well, and the remaining one became a professor of engineering.  <!-- there seems to be no source for the following anecdote, and the reference given does not mention selberg: his first result came at age 14 when he found[[johann bernoulli]]'s  remarkable 1697 formula :<math>\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n} = \int_0^1 x^{-x} dx\quad\quad(=1.291285997...)</math> which he published as a problem in the book ''problems and theorems in analysis'' (part i, problem 160) by [[pólya]] and [[gábor szegö]]. --> while he was still at school he was influenced by the work of [[srinivasa ramanujan]] and he found an exact analytical formula for the [[partition (number theory)#partition function|partition function]] as suggested by the works of ramanujan; however, this result was first published by [[hans rademacher]]. during the war he fought against the german invasion of norway, and was imprisoned several times.  he studied at the [[university of oslo]] and completed his [[ph.d.]] in 1943.  == world war ii == during [[world war ii]], selberg worked in isolation due to the [[german occupation of norway]]. after the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the [[riemann zeta function]] lie on the line <math>\re(s)=\tfrac{1}{2}</math>.    after the war, he turned to [[sieve theory]], a previously neglected topic which selberg's work brought into prominence. in a 1947 paper he introduced the [[selberg sieve]], a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to [[chen's theorem]], among other important results.  in 1948 selberg submitted two papers in ''[[annals of mathematics]]'' in which he proved by elementary means the theorems for [[primes in arithmetic progression]] and the [[prime number theorem|density of primes]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1969455|  title=an elementary proof of the

formula]], the most famous and influential of his results. in its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of [[closed geodesic]]s on a [[compact riemann surface]] and the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[laplace-beltrami operator|laplacian]], which is analogous to the duality between the [[prime number]]s and the zeros of the zeta function.  he was awarded the 1986 [[wolf

several [[central processing unit|processors]] in a [[parallel machine]] or in a network of computers working together. atomic semantics are very strong. an atomic register provides strong guarantees even when there is concurrency and failures.  a read/write register r stores a value and is accessed by two basic operations: read and write(v). a read  returns the value stored in r and write(v) changes the value stored in r to v. a register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties:  1) each invocation op of a read or write operation:  •must appear as if it were executed at a single point τ(op) in time.  •τ (op) works as follow: τb(op) ≤ τ (op) ≤ τe(op): where τb(op) and τe(op) indicate the time when the operation op begins and ends.  •if op1 ≠ op2, then τ (op1)≠τ (op2)  2) each read operation returns the value written by the last write operation before the read, in the sequence where all operations are ordered by their τ values.  '''atomic/linearizable register:'''  termination: when a node is correct,sooner or later each read and write operation will complete.  '''safety property''' (linearization points for read and write and failed operations):  read operation:it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.  write operation: similar to read operation,it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time.  failed operation(the atomic term comes from this notion):it appears as if it is completed at every single node or it never happened at any node.  example : we know that an atomic register is one that is linearizable to a sequential safe register.  [[file:atomic register1.jpg|centre|atomic]]  the following picture shows where we should put the linearization point for each operation:  [[file:atomic register.jpg|center|atomic register]]    an atomic register could be defined for a variable with a single writer but multi- readers(swmr),single-writer/single-reader (swsr),or multi-writer/multi-reader(mwmr). here is an example of a multi-reader multi-writer atomic register which is accessed by three processes (p1,p2,p3).note that r.read() → v means that the corresponding read operation returns v, which is the value of the register. therefore, the following execution of the register r could satisfies the definition of the atomic registers: r.write(1), r.read()→1, r.write(3), r.write(2), r.read()→2, r.read()→2.

}}Audiosignalprocessing | {{redirect|audio effect|special sounds used in media|sound effect|a device that processes sound|effects unit}}  '''audio signal processing''' or '''audio processing''' is the intentional alteration of [[audio signal]]s often through an '''audio effect''' or [[effects unit]]. as audio signals may be electronically represented in either [[digital signal (signal processing)|digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]] format, [[signal processing]] may occur in either domain.  analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on the digital representation of that signal.  == history == audio signals are electronic representations of [[sound wave]]s—[[longitudinal wave]]s which travel through air, consisting of compressions and rarefactions. the energy contained in audio signals is typically measured in [[decibel]]s. audio processing was necessary for early [[radio broadcasting]], as there were many problems with studio to transmitter links.<ref>{{cite book|last=atti|first=andreas spanias, ted painter, venkatraman|title=audio signal processing and coding|year=2006|publisher=john wiley & sons|location=hoboken, nj|isbn=0-471-79147-4|pages=464|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_z-oqbadpic|edition=[online-ausg.]}}</ref>  == analog signals == {{main|analog signal processing}} "analog" indicates something that is mathematically represented by a set of [[continuous function|continuous]] values; for example, the analog clock uses constantly moving hands on a physical clock face, where moving the hands directly alters the information that clock is providing. thus, an analog signal is one represented by a continuous stream of data, in this case along an electrical circuit in the form of voltage, current or charge changes ''(compare with digital signals below)''. analog signal processing (asp) then involves physically altering the continuous signal by changing the voltage or current or charge via various electrical means.  historically, before the advent of widespread [[digital technology]], asp was the only method by which to manipulate a signal. since that time, as computers and software became more advanced, digital signal processing has become the method of choice.  == digital signals == {{main|digital signal processing}} a digital representation expresses the [[sound pressure| pressure]] wave-form as a sequence of symbols, usually [[binary numeral system|binary]] numbers.  this permits signal processing using [[digital electronics|digital circuits]] such as [[microprocessor]]s and [[computer]]s.  although such a conversion can be prone to loss, most modern audio systems use this approach as the techniques of digital signal processing are much more powerful and efficient than analog domain signal processing.<ref>{{cite book|title=digital audio signal processing|first=udo |last=zölzer|publisher=john wiley and sons|year=

(phenomenon)|echo]] or [[reverb]] removal or addition, etc.)  === audio broadcasting ===  traditionally the most important audio processing (in audio broadcasting) takes place just before the transmitter. studio audio processing is limited in the modern era due to digital audio systems ([[mixing console|mixers]], routers) being pervasive in the studio.{{dubious|reason=digital audio systems have processing capabilities|date=august 2016}}  in audio broadcasting, the audio processor must * prevent or minimize [[overmodulation]], * compensate for non-linear transmitters (a potential issue with [[medium wave]] and [[shortwave]] broadcasting) and * adjust overall [[loudness]] to desired level  == techniques == audio unprocessed by reverb and delay is metaphorically referred to as "dry", while processed audio is referred to as "wet".<ref>hodgson, jay (2010). ''understanding records'', p.95. {{isbn|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.</ref>  * ''[[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]'' - to simulate the effect of reverberation in a large hall or cavern, one or several delayed signals are added to the original signal. to be perceived as echo, the delay has to be of order 35 milliseconds or above.  short of actually playing a sound in the desired environment, the effect of echo can be implemented using either [[digital data|digital]] or [[analog (signal)|analog]] methods.  analog echo effects are implemented using [[delay (audio effect)|tape delay]]s and/or [[spring reverb]]s.  when large numbers of delayed signals are mixed over several seconds, the resulting sound has the effect of being presented in a large room, and it is more commonly called [[reverberation]] or [[reverberation|reverb]] for short. * ''[[flanging|flanger]]'' - to create an unusual sound, a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a continuously variable delay (usually smaller than 10 ms).  this effect is now done electronically using [[digital signal processing|dsp]], but originally the effect was created by playing the same recording on two synchronized tape players, and then mixing the signals together.  as long as the machines were synchronized, the mix would sound more-or-less normal, but if the operator placed his finger on the flange of one of the players (hence "flanger"), that machine would slow down and its signal would fall out-of-phase with its partner, producing a phasing effect.  once the operator took his finger off, the player would speed up until its [[tachometer]] was back in phase with the master, and as this happened, the phasing effect would appear to slide up the frequency spectrum.  this phasing up-and-down the register can be performed rhythmically. * ''[[phaser (effect)|phaser]]'' - another way of creating an unusual sound; the signal is split, a portion is [[audio filter|filtered]] with an [[all-pass filter]] to produce a phase-shift, and then the unfiltered and filtered signals are mixed. the phaser effect was originally a simpler implementation of the flanger effect since delays were difficult to implement with analog equipment.  phasers are often used to give a "synthesized" or electronic effect to natural sounds, such as human speech.  the voice of [[c-3po]] from [[star wars]] was created by taking the actor's voice and treating it with a phaser. * ''[[chorus effect|chorus]]'' - a delayed signal is added to the original signal with a constant delay. the delay has to be short in order not to be perceived as echo, but above 5 ms to be audible.  if the delay is too short, it will destructively interfere with the un-delayed signal and create a [[flanging]] effect.  often, the delayed signals will be slightly pitch shifted to more realistically convey the effect of multiple voices. * ''[[equalization (audio)|equalization]]'' - different frequency bands are [[attenuation|attenuated]] or boosted to produce desired spectral characteristics. moderate use of equalization (often abbreviated as "eq") can be used to "fine-tune" the tone quality of a recording; extreme use of equalization, such as heavily cutting a certain frequency can create more unusual effects. * ''[[audio filter|filtering]]'' - equalization is a form of filtering.  in the general sense, frequency ranges can be emphasized or attenuated using [[low-pass filter|low-pass]], [[high-pass filter|high-pass]], [[band-pass filter|band-pass]] or [[band-stop filter|band-stop]] filters.  band-pass filtering of voice can simulate the effect of a telephone because telephones use band-pass filters. * ''[[overdriven|overdrive]]'' effects such as the use of a [[distortion (music)|fuzz box]] can be used to produce distorted sounds, such as for imitating robotic voices or to simulate distorted radiotelephone traffic (e.g., the radio chatter between starfighter pilots in the science fiction film ''[[star wars]]'') {{citation needed|date=august 2014}}.  the most basic overdrive effect involves ''clipping'' the signal when its [[absolute value]] exceeds a certain threshold. * ''[[audio timescale-pitch modification|pitch shift]]'' - this effect shifts a signal up or down in pitch. for example, a signal may be shifted an octave up or down.  this is usually applied to the entire signal, and not to each note separately. blending the original signal with shifted duplicate(s) can create harmonies from one voice.  another application of pitch shifting is [[pitch correction]].  here a musical signal is tuned to the correct pitch using digital signal processing techniques.  this effect is ubiquitous in karaoke machines and is often used to assist pop singers who sing out of tune.  it is also used intentionally for aesthetic effect in such pop songs as [[cher]]'s ''[[believe (cher song)|believe]]'' and [[madonna (entertainer)|madonna]]'s ''[[die another day (song)|die another day]]''. * ''[[audio timescale-pitch modification|time stretching]]'' - the complement of pitch shift, that is, the process of changing the speed of an audio signal without affecting its pitch. * ''[[resonators]]'' - emphasize harmonic frequency content on specified frequencies. these may be created from parametric eqs or from delay-based comb-filters. * ''[[robotic voice effects]]'' are used to make an actor's voice sound like a synthesized human voice. * ''[[synthesizer]]'' - generate artificially almost any sound by either imitating natural sounds or creating completely new sounds. * ''[[modulation]]'' - to change the frequency or amplitude of a carrier signal in relation to a predefined signal. [[ring modulator|ring modulation]], also known as amplitude modulation, is an effect made famous by [[doctor who]]'s [[dalek]]s and commonly used throughout sci-fi. * ''[[audio level compression|compression]]'' - the reduction of the dynamic range of a sound to avoid unintentional fluctuation in the dynamics.  level compression is not to be confused with [[audio data compression]], where the amount of data is reduced without affecting the amplitude of the sound it represents. * ''[[3d audio effect]]s'' - place sounds outside the stereo basis * ''[[reverse echo]]'' - a swelling effect created by reversing an audio signal and recording echo and/or delay while the signal runs in reverse. when played back forward the last echos are heard before the effected sound creating a rush like swell preceding and during playback. [[jimmy page]] of [[led zeppelin]] used this effect in the bridge of "[[whole lotta love]]".{{citation needed|date=may 2012}} * ''[[active noise control]]''- a method for reducing unwanted sound * ''[[wave field synthesis]]'' - a spatial audio rendering technique for the creation of virtual acoustic environments  == see also == * [[sound card]] * [[sound effect]]  == references == {{reflist}}  == further reading == *{{cite book | last = rocchesso | first = davide | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = introduction to sound processing | publisher = | date = march 20, 2003| pages = | url = http://dsp-book.narod.ru/spv.pdf | doi = | isbn = }} {{audio broadcasting}} {{music production}} {{defaultsort:audio signal processing}} [[category:audio electronics]] [[category:signal processing]]Aufileformat | {{no footnotes|date=january 2013}} {{infobox file format | name = au | icon = | logo = | screenshot = | caption = | extension = .au<br />.snd | mime = audio/basic | type code = | uniform type = | magic = .snd | owner = [[sun microsystems]] | type = [[audio file format]], [[container format (digital)|container format]] | container for = [[audio frequency|audio]], most often [[µ-law]] | contained by = | extended from = | extended to = | standard = }} the '''au file format''' is a simple [[audio file format]] introduced by [[sun microsystems]]. the format was common on [[next]] systems and on early web pages. originally it was headerless, being simply 8-bit [[mu-law|µ-law]]-encoded data at an 8000&nbsp;hz sample rate. hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192&nbsp;hz, often integer factors of video clock signals. newer files have a header that consists of six [[signedness|unsigned]] [[32-bit]] words, an optional information chunk and then the data (in [[big endian]] format).  although the format now supports many [[digital audio|audio encoding]] formats, it remains associated with the [[mu-law|µ-law]] logarithmic encoding. this encoding was native to the [[sparcstation 1]] hardware, where [[sunos]] exposed the encoding to application programs through the /dev/audio interface. this encoding and interface became a [[de facto]] standard for [[unix]] sound.  ==new format== all fields are stored in [[big-endian]] format, including the sample data. {{clear}} {| class="wikitable" width="100%" ! 32 bit word (unsigned) ! field ! description/content [[hexadecimal]] numbers in [[c (programming language)|c]] notation |- valign = top | 0 | [[magic number (programming)|magic number]] | the value <tt>0x2e736e64</tt> (four ascii characters ".snd") |- valign = top | 1 || data offset | the offset to the data in [[byte]]s, must be divisible by 8. the minimum valid number is 24 (decimal), since this is the header length (six 32-bit words) with no space reserved for extra information (the annotation field). the minimum valid number with an annotation field present is 32 (decimal). |- valign = top | 2 || data size | data size in bytes. if unknown, the value <tt>0xffffffff</tt> should be used. |- valign = top | 3 || encoding || data encoding format: *1 = 8-bit [[g.711]] [[mu-law algorithm|µ-law]] *2 = 8-bit linear [[pulse code modulation|pcm]] *3 = 16-bit linear [[pulse code modulation|pcm]] *4 = 24-bit linear [[pulse code modulation|pcm]] *5 = 32-bit linear [[pulse code modulation|pcm]] *6 = 32-bit [[ieee floating-point standard|ieee floating point]] *7 = 64-bit [[ieee floating-point standard|ieee floating point]] *8 = fragmented sample data *9 = dsp program *10 = 8-bit [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] *11 = 16-bit [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] *12 = 24-bit [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] *13 = 32-bit [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] *18 = 16-bit linear with emphasis *19 = 16-bit linear compressed *20 = 16-bit linear with emphasis and compression *21 = music kit dsp commands *23 = 4-bit compressed using the [[g.726|itu-t g.721]] [[adpcm]] voice data encoding scheme *24 = [[g.722|itu-t g.722]] [[sub-band adpcm|sb-adpcm]] *25 = [[g.723|itu-t g.723]] 3-bit [[adpcm]] *26 = [[g.723|itu-t g.723]] 5-bit [[adpcm]] *27 = 8-bit [[g.711]] [[a-law algorithm|a-law]] |- valign = top | 4 || sample rate | the number of samples/second, e.g., 8000 |- valign = top | 5 || channels | the number of interleaved channels, e.g., 1 for mono, 2 for stereo;

(the court decided that ''horch'' was a registered trademark on behalf of august horch's former partners and august horch was not entitled to use it any more). consequently, horch named his new company ''[[audi automobilwerke gmbh]]'' in 1910, ''audi'' being the latinization of horch.  ==post audi== horch left audi in 1920 and went to berlin and took various jobs.  he published his autobiography, ''i built cars (ich baute autos)'' in 1937.  he also served on the board of auto union, the successor to audi automobilwerke gmbh.  he was an honorary citizen of zwickau and had a street named for his audi cars in both zwickau and his birthplace winningen.  he was made an honorary professor at [[braunschweig university of technology]].<ref name="autoweek"/> ==after the war== after the war, there were left-wing circles who vilified august horch, claiming he was a nazi, and argued that his honorary citizenship of the city of zwickau should be withdrawn. horch was not a member of the [[nazi party]], nor did he have influence on the production of armaments, so the city council did not comply with the request. in early july 1945, horch moved to [[upper franconia]], where he<ref>die bezeichnung von else kolmar als pflegetochter ist den horch-akten im staatsarchiv chemnitz entnommen.</ref> and his housekeeper and foster daughter else kolmar first found an accommodation in helmbrechts and  three months later in münchberg. the wife of horch wife died on march 26, 1946, at a nursing home in berlin, a few days later his son eberhard. in the summer of 1948, horch and else kolmar, who came from a jewish family, married. <ref>jürgen pönisch: ''august horch – pionier der kraftfahrt''. hrsg. august horch museum zwickau, 2001, {{isbn|3-00-008754-0}}, s. 198,  201–206.</ref>  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{audi}}  {{authority control}}  {{defaultsort:horch, august}} [[category:1868 births]] [[category:1951 deaths]] [[category:audi people]] [[category:automotive pioneers]] [[category:auto union]] [[category:german engineers]] [[category:german company founders]] [[category:horch]] [[category:people from mayen-koblenz]] [[category:people from the rhine province]] [[category:articles lacking sources from june 2009]] [[category:all articles lacking sources]] [[category:german founders of automobile manufacturers]]Augustine | #redirect [[augustine of hippo]]AugustWilhelmAmbros | {{for|the comic strip cartoonist|ambrós}} [[image:ambros august wilhelm 1862.jpg|right|thumb]] '''august wilhelm ambros''' (17 november 1816{{snd}}28 june 1876)<ref name=blom>[[eric blom|blom, eric]] (2005) ''everyman's dictionary of music'', kessinger publishing. p. 15. {{isbn|1-4179-8918-1}}.</ref> was an [[austria]]n composer and music historian of [[czech people|czech]] descent.  == life == he was born at [[mýto]], [[rokycany district]], [[bohemia]].<ref name=blom /> his father was a cultured man, and his mother was the sister of [[raphael georg kiesewetter]]<ref>todd. r. larry.

allosomes, on the other hand, have different form and thereby determine  sex.  the [[dna]] in autosomes is collectively known as '''atdna''' or '''audna'''.<ref>http://www.isogg.org/wiki/autosomal_dna</ref>  for example, [[human]]s have a [[diploid]] [[human genome|genome]] that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one [[allosome]] pair (46 chromosomes total). the autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1–22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters.<ref>http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=autosome</ref>  by contrast, the allosome pair consists of two [[x chromosome]]s in females or one x and one [[y chromosome]] in males. (unusual combinations of [[xyy syndrome|xyy]], [[klinefelter syndrome|xxy]], [[triple x syndrome|xxx]], [[xxxx syndrome|xxxx]], [[xxxxx syndrome|xxxxx]] or [[xxyy syndrome|xxyy]], among [[aneuploidy|other allosome combinations]], are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.)  autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes. for example, the [[sry]] gene on the y chromosome encodes the transcription factor [[testis determining factor|tdf]] and is vital for male sex determination during development. tdf functions by activating the [[sox9]] gene on [[chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]], so mutations of the [[sox9]] gene can cause humans with a y chromosome to develop as females.<ref>foster, jamie w., et al.

parental germ cells or [[mendelian inheritance]] of deleterious alleles from parents. autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an [[autosomal dominant]] or recessive fashion.<ref name=":0" /> these disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = human genetic disease|url =

disorders are often present in both parent and child, as the child needs to inherit only one copy of the deleterious [[allele]] to manifest the disease. autosomal recessive diseases, however, require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest. because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype, two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers (also known as [[heterozygote]]s) for the condition.  autosomal [[aneuploidy]] can also result in disease conditions. aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus. fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-rich chromosomes—such as [[chromosome 1 (human)|chromosome 1]]—never

[[san vincenzo al volturno]] in south italy in the time of [[desiderius]], king of the [[lombards]].  autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at st. vicenzo, and both [[pope stephen iii]] and [[charlemagne]] intervened.  the disagreement was based both on objections to autpert's personality and to his frankish origin.  he wrote a considerable number of works on the bible and religious subjects generally. among these are commentaries on the [[apocalypse]], on the [[psalms]], and on the [[song of solomon]]; ''lives of saints paldo, tuto and vaso''; ''[[assumption of

[[tenochtitlan]] and ruler of the [[aztec triple alliance]].  ==biography==  ===early life and background=== axayacatl was a son of the princess [[atotoztli ii]] and her cousin, prince [[tezozomoc (son of itzcoatl)|tezozomoc]]. he was a grandson of the emperors [[moctezuma i]] and [[itzcoatl]]. he was a descendant of the king [[cuauhtototzin]].  he was a successor of moctezuma and his brothers were emperors [[tizoc]] and [[ahuitzotl]] and his sister was the queen [[chalchiuhnenetzin]]. he was an uncle of the emperor [[cuauhtémoc]] and father of emperors [[moctezuma ii]] and [[cuitláhuac]].  ===rise to power=== during his youth, his military prowess gained him the favor influential figures such as [[nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|nezahualcoyotl]] and [[tlacaelel i]], and thus, upon the death of [[moctezuma i]] in 1469, he was chosen to ascend to the throne, much to the displeasure of his two older brothers, [[tizoc]] and [[ahuitzotl]].  it is also important that the [[aztec calendar stone|great sun stone]], also known as the aztec calendar, was carved under his leadership. in the year 1475 there was a major earthquake that destroyed many homes in temochtitlán.{{citation needed|date=september 2016}}  ===military actions and death=== using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few tlatelolcan citizens, axayacatl invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, [[moquihuix]], and replaced him with a military governor. the tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming aztec policy.  axayacatl largely dedicated his twelve-year reign to consolidating his militaristic repute: he led successful [[aztec warfare|campaigns]] against the neighboring ''altepetl'' of [[tlatelolco (altepetl)|tlatelolco]] in 1473 and the [[matlatzinca people|matlatzinca]] of the [[toluca valley]] in 1474, but was finally defeated by the [[purépecha people|tarascan]]s of [[michoacán]] in 1476. despite some subsequent minor triumphs, axayacatl's defeat at the hands of the tarascans irreversibly marred his image, as it constituted the only major defeat suffered by the aztecs up to that moment. in spite of his young age, he fell gravely ill in 1480, passing away a mere year later, in 1481, whereupon he was succeeded by his brother tizoc.

'''formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[robert s. hartman]]'s [[science of value]].  ==history== between the 5th and 6th century bc, it was important in greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[socrates]] held the belief that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[socrates]]' student, [[plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all.  with the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped christianity. during the medieval times, [[thomas aquinas]] argued for a separation between natural and religious virtues.  this concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.<ref name="autogenerated70">arneson, p.

of human communication. the axiological issues that are significant for the evolution of communication theory are whether research can be truly free of value and whether the end for the administered research should be designed to expand knowledge or to change society. for communication theorists, a primary interest is with the philosophical establishment of the research approach.  a continuing value debate occurs between scholars who comply with a conventional scientific approach and those who take an [[interactionism|interpretivist]] approach to communication development.<ref name="autogenerated70"/>  those who take a conventional scientific approach believe that research must be free of values in order to be valid. therefore, it is necessary for the scientist to approach their research in a neutral and objective manner. in contrast, the interpretivists argue that it is impossible for research to be completely free of personal values, as research is always biased towards the values of the researcher. according to interpretivists, these [[bias|biases]] are sometimes so entrenched in the researcher's culture that they will most likely go unnoticed during research. since no one can truly be unbiased, some groups are more knowledgeable about certain things than other groups due to their positions in society, and they can be considered more qualified to perform research on certain topics as a result.<ref name="autogenerated70"/>  ==see also== *[[money]] *[[nihilism]] *[[n.o. lossky]] *[[russian philosophy]] *[[utility]] *[[value (economics)]]

[[aminoglycoside|aminoglycosidic antibiotics]]  are usually considered bactericidal, although they may be bacteriostatic with some organisms  the distinction between bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents appears to be clear according to the basic/clinical definition, but this only applies under strict laboratory conditions and it is important to distinguish microbiological and clinical definitions.<ref>{{cite journal |title=clinical relevance of bacteriostatic versus bactericidal mechanisms of action in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections  |journal=clin infect dis.  |year=2004 |volume=38 |issue=6 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/6/864.long |pages=864–870 |doi=10.1086/381972 |pmid=14999632 | last1 = pankey | first1 = ga | last2 = sabath | first2 = ld}}  </ref> the distinction is more arbitrary when agents are categorized in clinical situations. the supposed superiority of bactericidal agents over bacteriostatic agents is of little relevance when treating the vast majority of infections with [[gram-positive bacteria]], particularly in patients with uncomplicated infections and noncompromised immune systems. bacteriostatic agents have been effectively used for treatment that are considered to require bactericidal activity. furthermore, some broad classes of antibacterial agents considered bacteriostatic can exhibit bactericidal activity against some bacteria on the basis of in vitro determination of mbc/mic values. at high concentrations, bacteriostatic agents are often bactericidal against some susceptible organisms. the ultimate guide to treatment of any infection must be clinical outcome.  == references == {{reflist}}  ==see also== * [[list of antibiotics]] * [[microbicide]]  {{pharmacology}}  [[category:bactericides| ]]Bacteriostat | #redirect [[bacteriostatic agent]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from alternative name}} }}BahamasMilitary | #redirect [[royal bahamas defence force]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}BahamasTransnationalissues | #redirect [[foreign relations of the bahamas]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}BahrainGeography | #redirect [[bahrain]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}Ball | {{other uses}} {{pp-semi-indef}} {{pp-move-indef}} {{wiktionary}} a '''ball''' is a round object (usually [[sphere|spherical]] but sometimes [[ovoid]]) with various uses. it is used in [[ball game]]s, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, [[marbles]] and [[juggling]]. balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in [[engineering]] applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as [[ball bearings]]. [[black powder|black-powder]] weapons use stone and metal balls as [[projectile]]s.  although many types of balls are today made from [[rubber]], this form was unknown outside the americas until after the voyages of [[christopher columbus|columbus]]. the spanish were the first europeans to see bouncing rubber balls (albeit solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the [[mesoamerican ballgame]]. balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials.  as balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word "ball" is used to refer to, or to describe, anything spherical or near-spherical.  == etymology == the first known use of the word ''ball'' in english in the sense of a globular body that is played with was in 1205 in ''{{lang|la|[[laȝamon's brut, or chronicle of britain]]}}'' in the phrase, "{{lang|la|summe heo driuen balles wide ȝeond þa feldes.}}" the word came from the [[middle english]] ''bal'' (inflected as ''ball-e, -es'', in turn from [[old norse]] ''böllr'' (pronounced {{ipa-non|bɔlːr|}}; compare old swedish ''baller,'' and swedish ''boll'') from [[proto-germanic]] ''ballu-z,'' (whence probably middle high german ''bal, ball-es,'' middle dutch ''bal''), a [[cognate]] with [[old high german]] ''ballo, pallo,'' middle high german balle from proto-germanic ''*ballon'' (weak masculine), and old high german ''ballâ, pallâ,'' middle high german ''balle,'' proto-germanic ''*ballôn'' (weak feminine). no old english representative of any of these is known. (the answering forms in old english would have been ''beallu, -a, -e''—compare ''bealluc, ballock''.) if ''ball-'' was native in germanic, it may have been a cognate with the latin ''foll-is'' in sense of a "thing blown up or inflated." in the later middle english spelling ''balle'' the word coincided graphically with the french ''balle'' "ball" and "bale" which has hence been erroneously assumed to be its source. french ''balle'' (but not ''boule'') is assumed to be of germanic origin, itself, however. in [[ancient greek]] the word πάλλα (''palla'') for "ball" is attested<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0057%3aentry%3dpa%2flla&highlight=ball πάλλα], henry george liddell, robert scott, ''a greek-english lexicon'', on perseus</ref> besides the word "σφαίρα", ''[[sphere]]''.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus%3atext%3a1999.04.0057%3aentry%3dsfai%3dra^&highlight=ball σφαίρα],  henry george liddell, robert scott, ''a greek-english lexicon'', on perseus</ref>  ==history== [[file:russian balls 12-13.jpg|thumb|russian leather balls ({{lang-ru|мячи}}), 12th-13th century.]] a ball, as the essential feature in many forms of gameplay requiring physical exertion, must date from the very earliest times. a rolling object appeals not only to a [[human baby]] but to a [[kitten]] and a [[puppy]]. some form of game with a ball is found portrayed on [[ancient egypt|egyptian]] monuments, and is played among aboriginal tribes at the present day. in [[homer]], [[nausicaa]] was playing at ball with her maidens when [[odysseus]] first saw her in the land of the [[phaeacia]]ns (od. vi. 100). and halios and laodamas performed before [[alcinous]] and odysseus with ball play, accompanied with dancing (od. viii. 370).  ===ancient greeks=== among the [[ancient greece|greeks]] games with balls (σφαῖραι) were regarded as a useful subsidiary to the more violent athletic exercises, as a means of keeping the body supple, and rendering it graceful, but were generally left to boys and girls. of regular rules for the playing of ball games, little trace remains, if there were any such. the names in greek for various forms, which have come down to us in such works as the ὀνομαστικόν of [[julius pollux]], imply little or nothing of such; thus, ἀπόρραξις (''aporraxis'') only means the putting of the ball on the ground with the open hand, οὐρανία (''ourania''), the flinging of the ball in the air to be caught by two or more players; φαινίνδα (''phaininda'') would seem to be a game of catch played by two or more, where feinting is used as a test of quickness and skill. pollux (i. x. 104) mentions a game called [[episkyros]] (ἐπίσκυρος), which has often been looked on as the origin of football. it seems to have been played by two sides, arranged in lines; how far there was any form of "goal" seems uncertain.<ref name="eb1911">{{cite eb1911|wstitle=ball}}</ref>  ===ancient romans=== among the [[ancient rome|romans]], ball games were looked upon as an adjunct to the bath, and were graduated to the age and health of the bathers, and usually a place (sphaeristerium) was set apart for them in the baths (thermae). there appear to have been three types or sizes of ball, the [[pila (ball)|pila]], or small ball, used in catching games, the [[paganica (ball game)|paganica]], a heavy ball stuffed with feathers, and the [[follis (ball game)|follis]], a leather ball filled with air, the largest of the three. this was struck from player to player, who wore a kind of [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] on the arm. there was a game known as [[trigon (game)|trigon]], played by three players standing in the form of a triangle, and played with the follis, and also one known as [[harpastum]], which seems to imply a "scrimmage" among several players for the ball. these games are known to us through the romans, though the names are greek.<ref name="eb1911"/>  ===modern ball games=== the various modern games played with a ball or balls and subject to rules are treated under their various names, such as [[polo]], [[cricket]], [[football]], etc.<ref name="eb1911"/>  == round balls == <gallery> file:football pallo valmiina-cropped.jpg|[[football (association football)|football]] from association football (soccer) file:baseball (crop).jpg|[[baseball (ball)|baseball]] file:basketball.png|[[basketball (ball)|basketball]] file:billiards balls.jpg|[[billiard ball]]s file:ball and pin.jpg|[[bowling ball]] (and [[bowling pin|pin]]) file:brine lax ball.jpg|[[lacrosse ball]] file:cricket-ball-red-madeinaustralia.jpg|[[cricket ball]] file:golfball.jpg|[[golf ball]] next to a hole file:tennis_ball_01.jpg|[[tennis ball]] file:volleyball.jpg|[[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] file:newwaterpoloball.jpg|[[water polo ball]] file:green_rubber_band_ball.jpg|[[rubber band ball]] </gallery>  == prolate spheroid balls == several sports use a ball in the shape of a [[prolate spheroid]]: <gallery> file:rugbyball2.jpg|[[rugby union ball]] file:sherrin.png|[[australian rules football]] file:wilson american football.jpg|[[football (ball)#american and canadian football|american football]] file:canadian football.png|[[football (ball)#american and canadian football|canadian football]] </gallery>  == see also == * [[ball (mathematics)]] * [[buckminster fullerene]] * [[football (ball)]] * [[kickball]] * [[marbles]] * [[penny floater]] * [[prisoner ball]] * [[shuttlecock]] * [[super ball]]  == references == {{reflist}}  [[category:balls| ]]Ballbaseballstatistics | #redirect [[strike zone]]BallroomDance | #redirect [[ballroom dance]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from camelcase}} }}Ballroomdancing | #redirect [[ballroom dance]]BalticSea | #redirect [[baltic sea]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from camelcase}} }}BaltimoreRavens | #redirect [[baltimore ravens]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from camelcase}} }}BanachTarskiParadoxicalDecomposition | #redirect [[banach–tarski paradox]]BangladeshForeignrelations | #redirect [[foreign relations of bangladesh]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}  {{nahmc|foreign relations of bangladesh}}BangladeshTransnationalissues | #redirect [[foreign relations of bangladesh]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from subpage}} }}  {{nahmc|foreign relations of bangladesh}}Bangra | #redirect [[bhangra]]Banonassaultrifles | #redirect [[assault weapons legislation in the united states]]Baptistchurch | #redirect [[baptists]]BarbaraOlson | {{infobox person |name         = barbara olson |image        = olson.barbara.jpg |image_size   = 180px |caption      = |birth_name   = barbara kay bracher |birth_date   = {{birth date|1955|12|27}}  |birth_place  = [[houston, texas]], u.s. |death_date   = {{death date and age|2001|9|11|1955|12|27}}  |death_place  = [[arlington county, virginia]], u.s. |death_cause  = killed in the deliberate crash of [[american airlines flight 77]] into the pentagon, 9/11 |nationality  = [[united states|american]] |known_for    = fox news and cnn commentator |years_active = 1990–2001 |education    = [[waltrip high school]] |alma_mater   = [[university of st. thomas (houston)|university of saint thomas]],<br/>[[yeshiva university]] |party        = [[republican party (united states)|republican]] |religion     =  |employer     = |occupation   = political commentator,<br/>lawyer |spouse       = [[theodore olson]] <small>(1996–2001)</small> }} '''barbara kay olson''' (née '''bracher''';

washington, d.c.-based law firm of [[wilmer cutler & pickering]] where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an [[assistant u.s. attorney]].  olson's support in 1991 of supreme court nominee [[clarence thomas]] led to the formation of the [[independent women's forum]]. at that time, olson and friend [[rosalie (ricky) gaull silberman]] started an informal network of women who supported the thomas nomination to the supreme court despite allegations of sexual harassment by [[anita hill]], a former subordinate of thomas at the [[equal employment opportunity commission]]. olson, who had also worked under thomas at the eeoc and was a close friend of thomas, spoke out on his behalf during his contentious senate confirmation hearings. olson later helped edit ''[[the real anita hill]]'', a book by [[david brock]] that savaged hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political dirty trick (brock later recanted his claims and apologized to hill). the independent women's forum continued on with a goal of retaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility.  in 1994, olson became chief investigative counsel for the [[united states house of representatives|u.s. house of representatives]] [[united states house committee on oversight and government reform|committee on oversight and government

"the bass differs from other voices because of the particular role it plays in supporting and defining harmonic motion. it does so at levels ranging from immediate, chord-by-chord events to the larger harmonic organization of a entire work."<ref>cadwallader, allen (1998).

english civil war}} }}  the '''battles of lostwithiel''' or '''lostwithiel campaign''', took place near [[lostwithiel]] and [[fowey]] in cornwall during the [[first english civil war]] in 1644. they resulted in victory for the royalists commanded by [[charles i of england|king charles]] over the parliamentarians commanded by the [[robert devereux, 3rd earl of essex|earl of essex]].  ==prelude== after defeating the army of sir [[william waller]] at the [[battle of cropredy bridge]], king charles marched west in pursuit of the parliamentarian army of the earl of essex, who was invading the royalist stronghold of [[cornwall]].  essex had been misled into believing that he could expect substantial support from the people of cornwall. when he had reached [[bodmin]] on 28 july, he found that there was no chance of supplies or recruits, and he also learned that the royalist army was at [[launceston, cornwall|launceston]], close to his rear. he withdrew to [[lostwithiel]], covering the port of [[fowey]]. essex had previously arranged to rendezvous at fowey with the parliamentarian fleet under the [[robert rich, 2nd earl of warwick|earl of warwick]], but no ships appeared. warwick was unable to leave [[portsmouth]] because of westerly winds.  charles's army had been reinforced as it marched, and outnumbered that of essex by nearly two to one. the first clashes took place on 2 august, but little action took place for several days, as the king waited for all his forces to arrive and essex waited for the fleet.  ==battle== on 13 august, the royalists began to attack in earnest, occupying several outposts on the east bank of the [[river fowey]], making it even more difficult for help to reach essex. a parliamentarian attempt to send a relieving force under lieutenant general [[john middleton, 1st earl of middleton|middleton]] was defeated at [[bridgwater]] in [[somerset]].  on 21 august, the royalists attacked essex's positions north of lostwithiel, capturing the ruins of [[restormel castle]]. royalist cavalry threatened to cut the parliamentarians off from fowey. essex realised that there was no hope of relief and ordered his cavalry to break out of the encirclement. under sir [[william balfour (general)|william balfour]], they broke through the royalist lines on the night of 31 august, eventually reaching [[plymouth]] thirty miles to the east.  the increasingly demoralised parliamentarian infantry fell back towards fowey in pouring rain. they were forced to abandon several guns which became bogged down in the muddy roads. on 1 september, the pursuing royalists captured [[castle dore]], another ruined fortification which the parliamentarians were using to anchor their lines. essex left sir [[philip skippon]], his sergeant major general of foot, in command while he himself escaped to plymouth in a fishing boat.  on 2 september, skippon, having been told that his infantry were unable to break out as the cavalry had done, and having been offered generous terms by the king, surrendered 6,000 infantry and all his army's guns and train.  ==aftermath== the disarmed soldiers marched eastward to portsmouth in continuing bad weather, being continually robbed and threatened by local people. about 1,000 died of exposure and hunger, and 1,000 more deserted or fell sick.  charles meanwhile wheeled about and marched towards london.  this setback for parliament in [[cornwall]], and the last major victory for the royalists, was reversed by [[sir thomas fairfax]] leading the [[new model army]] at or near [[tresillian|tresillian bridge]], close to [[truro]] on 12 march 1645.  ==see also== *[[battle of braddock down]] which took place in january 1643 a few miles from lostwithiel.  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== *

{{disambiguation}}Beadweaving | '''bead weaving''' (or beadweaving) using [[seed beads]] can be done either on a [[loom]] or using one of a number of off-loom stitches.  ==on-loom beadweaving== [[image:apachebeadloom1903.png|thumb|355px|an old bead loom. 1. roller. 2. roller end. 3. spacers. 4. spacers.]]  when weaving on a loom, the beads are locked in between the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] threads by the [[weft]] threads.  the most common bead weaving technique requires two passes of the weft thread.  first, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft [[yarn|thread]].  then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads.  the [[sewing needle|needle]] is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. heddle looms were popular near the beginning of the 20th century. they allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. there are still a few heddle bead looms being manufactured today. the most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.  although loomed pieces are typically rectangular, it is possible to increase and decrease to produce angular or curvy shapes.  [[fringe (trim)|fringe]] can also be added during weaving or before the piece is removed from the loom.  bead looms vary in size and are typically made of wood or metal.  usually, a [[comb]] or [[spring (device)|spring]] is used to hold the warp threads a bead-width apart.  some looms have roller bars that allow the weaver to produce pieces that are longer than the loom.  most looms are meant to sit on a table, but some have floor stands or are meant to sit in the [[lap]].  ==off-loom beadweaving==  off-loom beadweaving is a family of [[beadwork]] techniques in which seed [[bead]]s are woven together into a flat [[cloth|fabric]], a tubular rope, or a three-dimensional object such as a ball, clasp, box, or a piece of jewelry. all off-loom techniques can be accomplished using a single needle and thread (no warp threads), but some have two-needle variations. different stitches produce pieces with distinct textures, shapes, and patterns.  there are many different off-loom bead stitches, including new stitches (distinct thread paths) published only in 2015: * albion stitch, developed by heather kingsley-heath, published may 2009<ref>{{cite

that is commonly used to mount the head on a rug. there was an egg case inside the skull that had been laid by a tropical cockroach that could not possibly be found in britain. there were also cut

belgian blue breed.<ref name=kambadur /> in 1978 belgian blue cattle were introduced to the united states by nick tutt, a farmer from central canada who immigrated to west texas and showed the cattle to universities in the region.{{clarify|date=july 2015}}  == breed characteristics == the belgian blue has a natural [[mutation]] in the [[myostatin]] gene which codes for the protein, [[myostatin]] ("myo" meaning muscle and "statin" meaning stop).<ref name=kambadur />  myostatin is a protein that inhibits muscle development. this mutation also interferes with fat deposition, resulting in very lean meat.<ref name=kambadur /> the truncated myostatin gene is unable to function in its normal capacity, resulting in accelerated lean muscle growth. muscle growth is due primarily to physiological changes in the animal's muscle cells (fibers) from hypertrophy to a hyperplasia mode of growth. this particular type of growth is seen early in the fetus of a pregnant dam, which results in a calf that is born with two times the number of muscle fibers at birth than a calf with no myostatin gene mutation.<ref name=kambadur /> in addition a new born double-muscled calf’s birth weight is significantly greater than that of a normal calf .<ref name="de smet"/>  belgian blue cattle have improved feed conversion ratio (fcr) due to lower feed intake compared to weight gain.<ref name="de smet" /> the ability for these animals to have improved fcr is due to an altered composition of body weight gain which includes increased protein and decreased fat deposition.<ref name="de smet" /> the belgian blue’s bone structure is the same as a normal cow, albeit holding a greater amount of muscle, which causes them to have a greater meat to bone ratio. these cattle have a muscle yield of about 20% more on average than cattle without the genetic myostatin mutation.<ref name=kambadur /> because of this breed’s increased muscle yield a diet containing higher protein is required to compensate for the altered mode of weight gain.<ref name="de smet" /> during finishing this breed requires high-energy (concentrated) feeds, and will not yield the same results if put on a high-fiber diet.<ref name="de smet" />  the value of the double-muscling breed is due to their superior carcass characteristics. however, with decreased fat content there is decreased marbling of meat, which means the meat tenderness is reduced. conversely, the belgian blue's meat tenderness has been argued to be just as tender because there are a large number of smaller muscle fibers.{{citation needed|reason=argued by whom?|date=july 2015}} the belgian blue's meat cuts also have a lower collagen content, which allows the protein quality to be improved due to a higher yield of amino acids.<ref name="de smet" />  == breed problems == double-muscled cows can experience [[dystocia]] (a difficult birth), even when bred to normal beef bulls or dairy bulls, because of a narrower birth canal.{{r|norm|page=256}}  in addition to the dam’s reduced pelvic dimensions, the calf’s birth weight and width are increased, making parturition harder.<ref name=kambadur /> the [[:wikt:neonatal|neonatal]] calf is so large that [[caesarean section]]s are routinely scheduled for breeders.{{r|norm|page=256}}<ref>{{cite web|last=educational vet video|title=video of cow caesarean

quality have been observed as reduced, however this seems to be less of an issue when compared to the dam's difficulties in calving.<ref name="de smet" />  == economic efficiency == the economics of breeding and raising belgian blue cattle are inconclusive because of complications experienced during parturition and metabolic demand for increased concentrated feeds. the breed's increased need to have caesarean sections when calving means increased cost and added work, and can become a welfare issue.{{citation needed|date=july 2015}} however, the carcass value of double-muscled animals may be enhanced due to increased dressing yield, lean carcass content, and upgrading of some cuts leading to a higher proportion of higher valued cuts.<ref name="de smet" />  the slower rate of fat deposition causes slaughtering to be delayed in most cases, which means an increase in maintenance costs in those animals. belgian blue cattle require more skilled management and do not thrive in harsh environments.<ref name="de smet" />  for these reasons and others, the breed's overall production efficiency in an economic sense is still unclear.  == references == {{reflist|refs=  <ref

(that is, the same pair of parentheses is used to indicate both [[function application]] and the formation of an [[ordered pair]].)  ==examples== division of [[integer|whole numbers]] can be thought of as a function; if '''z''' is the set of [[integer]]s, '''n'''<sup>+</sup> is the set of [[natural number]]s (except for zero), and '''q''' is the set of [[rational number]]s, then [[division (mathematics)|division]] is a binary function from '''z''' and '''n'''<sup>+</sup> to '''q'''.  another example is that of inner products, or more generally functions of the form <math>(x,y)\mapsto x^tmy</math> where ''x,y'' are real-valued vectors of appropriate size and ''m'' is a matrix. if ''m'' is a [[positive definite matrix]], this yields an [[inner product]].<ref>{{cite

education|location=toronto|page=591|accessdate=16 august 2016}}</ref>  ==restrictions to ordinary functions== in turn, one can also derive ordinary functions of one variable from a binary function. given any element ''x'' of ''x'', there is a function ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup>, or ''f'' (''x'',·), from ''y'' to ''z'', given by ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup>(''y'') := ''f'' (''x'',''y''). similarly, given any element ''y'' of ''y'', there is a function ''f'' <sub>''y''</sub>, or ''f''  (·,''y''), from ''x'' to ''z'', given by ''f'' <sub>''y''</sub>(''x'') := ''f''  (''x'',''y''). in computer science, this identification between a function from ''x'' × ''y'' to ''z'' and a function from ''x'' to ''z''<sup>''y''</sup>, where ''z''<sup>''y''</sup> is the set of all functions from ''y'' to ''z'', is called ''[[currying]]''.  ==generalisations== the various concepts relating to functions can also be generalised to binary functions. for example, the division example above is ''[[surjective function|surjective]]'' (or ''onto'') because every rational number may be expressed as a quotient of an integer and a natural number. this example is ''[[injective function|injective]]'' in each input separately, because the functions ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup> and ''f'' <sub>''y''</sub> are always injective. however, it's not injective in both variables simultaneously, because (for example) ''f'' (2,4) = ''f'' (1,2).  one can also consider ''partial'' binary functions, which may be defined only for certain values of the inputs. for example, the division example above may also be interpreted as a partial binary function from '''z''' and '''n''' to '''q''', where '''n''' is the set of all natural numbers, including zero. but this function is undefined when the second input is zero.  a [[binary operation]] is a binary function where the sets ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all equal; binary operations are often used to define [[algebraic structure]]s.  in [[linear algebra]], a [[bilinear operator|bilinear transformation]] is a binary function where the sets ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are all [[vector space]]s and the derived functions ''f'' <sup>''x''</sup> and ''f''<sub>''y''</sub> are all [[linear transformation]]s. a bilinear transformation, like any binary function, can be interpreted as a function from ''x'' × ''y'' to ''z'', but this function in general won't be linear. however, the bilinear transformation can also be interpreted as a single linear transformation from the [[tensor product]] <math>x \otimes y</math> to ''z''.  ==generalisations to ternary and other functions== {{see also|multivariate function}} the concept of binary function generalises to ''ternary'' (or ''3-ary'') ''function'', ''quaternary'' (or ''4-ary'') ''function'', or more generally to ''n-ary function'' for any [[natural number]] ''n''. a ''0-ary function'' to ''z'' is simply given by an element of ''z''. one can also define an ''a-ary function'' where ''a'' is any [[set (mathematics)|set]]; there is one input for each element of ''a''.  ==category theory== in [[category theory]], ''n''-ary functions generalise to ''n''-ary morphisms in a [[multicategory]]. the interpretation of an ''n''-ary morphism as an ordinary morphisms whose domain is some sort of product of the domains of the original ''n''-ary morphism will work in a [[monoidal category]]. the construction of the derived morphisms of one variable will work in a [[closed monoidal category]]. the category of sets is closed monoidal, but so is the category of vector spaces, giving the notion of bilinear transformation above.  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{defaultsort:binary function}} [[category:types of functions]]BinaryOperation | #redirect [[binary

journal related to biometry|biometrics (journal)}}  '''biostatistics''' is the application of [[statistics]] to a wide range of topics in [[biology]]. the science of biostatistics encompasses the design of biological [[experiment]]s, especially in [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[agriculture]] and [[fisheries|fishery]]; the collection, summarization, and analysis of data from those experiments; and the interpretation of, and inference from, the results. a major branch of this is medical biostatistics,<ref>{{cite book|title=medical biostatistics|author=[[abhaya indrayan]]|publisher=crc press|year=2012|isbn= 978-1-4398-8414-0}}</ref> which is exclusively concerned with medicine and health.  == history == {{further|alternatives to darwinism}}  biostatistical modeling forms an important part of numerous modern biological theories. in the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of [[gregor mendel]]'s [[mendelian inheritance]] work, the gaps in understanding between [[genetics]] and evolutionary [[darwinism]] led to vigorous debate between biometricians, such as [[walter frank raphael weldon|walter weldon]] and [[karl pearson]], and mendelians, such as [[charles benedict davenport|charles davenport]], [[william bateson]] and [[wilhelm johannsen]]. by the 1930s, statisticians and models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-darwinian [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].  the leading figures in the establishment of [[population genetics]] and this synthesis all relied on statistics and developed its use in biology. * [[ronald fisher]] developed several basic statistical methods in support of his work studying the field experiments at [[rothamsted research]], including in his 1930 book ''[[the genetical theory of natural selection]]'' * [[sewall g. wright]] developed [[f-statistics]] and methods of computing them  * [[j. b. s. haldane]]'s book, ''the causes of evolution'', reestablished natural selection as the premier mechanism of evolution by explaining it in terms of the mathematical consequences of mendelian genetics.  these and other biostatisticians, [[mathematical biology|mathematical biologists]], and statistically inclined geneticists helped bring together [[evolutionary biology]] and [[genetics]] into a consistent, coherent whole that could begin to be [[statistics|quantitative]]ly modeled.  in parallel to this overall development, the pioneering work of [[d'arcy thompson]] in ''on growth and form'' also helped to add quantitative discipline to biological study.  despite the fundamental importance and frequent necessity of statistical reasoning, there may nonetheless have been a tendency among biologists to distrust or deprecate results which are not [[qualitative data|qualitatively]] apparent. one anecdote describes [[thomas hunt morgan]] banning the [[friden, inc.|friden calculator]] from his department at [[caltech]], saying "well, i am like a guy who is prospecting for gold along the banks of the sacramento river in 1849. with a little intelligence, i can reach down and pick up big nuggets of gold. and as long as i can do that, i'm not going to let any people in my department waste scarce resources in [[placer mining]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tilsonfunds.com/mungerucsbspeech.pdf|title=academic economics: strengths and faults after considering interdisciplinary needs|author=charles t. munger|date=2003-10-03}}</ref>  == recent developments == {{refimprove section|date=december 2016}}  recent developments have made a large impact on biostatistics. two important changes have been the ability to collect data on a high-throughput scale, and the ability to perform much more complex analysis using computational techniques.  === use in high-throughput data ===  new biomedical technologies like [[dna microarray|microarrays]], [[dna sequencing|next generation sequencers]] (for genomics) and [[mass spectrometers|mass spectrometry]] (for proteomics) generate enormous amounts of data, allowing many tests to be performed simultaneously.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=hayden|first1=erika check|title=biostatistics: revealing analysis|journal=nature|date=8 february 2012|volume=482|issue=7384|pages=263–265|doi=10.1038/nj7384-263a}}</ref> careful analysis with biostatistical methods is required to separate the signal from the noise. for example, a microarray could be used to measure many thousands of genes simultaneously, determining which of them have different expression in diseased cells compared to normal cells. however, only a fraction of genes will be differentially expressed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=efron|first1=bradley|title=microarrays, empirical bayes and the two-groups model|journal=statistical science|date=february 2008|volume=23|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1214/07-sts236|arxiv=0808.0572}}</ref>  [[multicollinearity]] often occurs in high-throughput biostatistical settings. due to high intercorrelation between the predictors (such as [[gene expression]] levels), the information of one predictor might be contained in another one. it could be that only 5% of the predictors are responsible for 90% of the variability of the response. in such a case, one could apply the biostatistical technique of dimension reduction (for example via principal component analysis). classical statistical techniques like linear or logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis do not work well for high dimensional data (i.e. when the number of observations n is smaller than the number of features or predictors p: n < p). as a matter of fact, one can get quite high r<sup>2</sup>-values despite very low predictive power of the statistical model. these classical statistical techniques (esp. least squares linear regression) were developed for low dimensional data (i.e. where the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p: n >> p). in cases of high dimensionality, one should always consider an independent validation test set and the corresponding residual sum of squares (rss) and r<sup>2</sup> of the validation test set, not those of the training set.  often, it is useful to pool information from multiple predictors together. for example, gene set enrichment analysis (gsea) considers the perturbation of whole (functionally related) gene sets rather than of single genes. these gene sets might be known biochemical pathways or otherwise functionally related genes. the advantage of this approach is that it is more robust: it is more likely that a single gene is found to be falsely perturbed than it is that a whole pathway is falsely perturbed. furthermore, one can integrate the accumulated knowledge about biochemical pathways (like the [[jak-stat signaling pathway]]) using this approach.  === use of computationally intensive methods ===  on the other hand, the advent of modern computer technology and relatively cheap computing resources have enabled computer-intensive biostatistical methods like [[bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]] and [[resampling (statistics)|resampling]] methods.  in recent times, [[random forests]] have gained popularity as a method for performing [[statistical classification]]. random forest techniques generate a panel of decision trees. decision trees have the advantage that you can draw them and interpret them (even with a very basic understanding of mathematics and statistics). random forests have thus been used for clinical decision support systems.{{citation needed|date=december 2016}}  ==applications== {{prose|section|date=march 2016}} * [[public health]], including [[epidemiology]], [[health services

and training programs == almost all educational programmes in biostatistics are at [[postgraduate]] level. they are most often found in schools of public health, affiliated with schools of medicine, forestry, or agriculture, or as a focus of application in departments of statistics.  in the united states, where several universities have dedicated biostatistics departments, many other top-tier universities integrate biostatistics faculty into statistics or other departments, such as [[epidemiology]]. thus, departments carrying the name "biostatistics" may exist under quite different structures. for instance, relatively new biostatistics departments have been founded with a focus on [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]], whereas older departments, typically affiliated with schools of [[public health]], will have more traditional lines of research involving epidemiological studies and [[clinical trial]]s as well as bioinformatics. in larger universities where both a statistics and a biostatistics department exist, the degree of integration between the two departments may range from the bare minimum to very close collaboration. in general, the difference between a statistics program and a biostatistics program is twofold: (i) statistics departments will often host theoretical/methodological research which are less common in biostatistics programs and (ii) statistics departments have lines of research that may include biomedical applications but also other areas such as industry ([[quality control]]), business and [[economics]] and biological areas other than medicine.  ==see also== * [[bioinformatics]] * [[epidemiological method]] * [[epidemiology]] * [[group size measures]] * [[health indicator]] * [[list of statistics

{{disambiguation}}Blackletterlaw | {{refimprove|date=april 2008}} [[image:l old london.svg|right|thumb|[[blackletter]] ''l'']] in [[common law]] legal systems, '''black letter laws''' are the well-established legal rules that are no longer subject to reasonable dispute.<ref>http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095510675</ref> some examples are the "black-letter law" of [[contract]]s or the "black-letter law" of [[trademark]]s.  black-letter law can be contrasted with [[legal theory]] or unsettled legal issues.  ==history and etymology== in a 1831 case in the [[u.s. supreme court]], ''jackson [[ex dem.]] bradford v. huntington'', the phrase "[[black letter]]" was used: ''"it is seldom that a case in our time savors so much of the black letter, but the course of decisions in new york renders it unavailable..."''.<ref>''jackson ex dem. bradford v. huntington'', 30 u.s. 402, 432 (1831).</ref> the phrase "black-letter law" was used in the [[pennsylvania supreme court]] case ''naglee v. ingersoll,'' 7 pa. 185 (1847). the phrase does not come from association with [[black's law dictionary]], which was first published in 1891. instead, it presumably refers to the practice of setting law books and citing legal precedents in [[blackletter]] type, a tradition that survived long after the switch to roman and italic text for other printed works.  the phrase definitely refers to a distillation of the [[common law]] into general and accepted legal principles. one can see this in the quote above from the supreme court where the court is noting that while the black letter law is clear, [[new york (state)|new york]] precedent deviates from the general principles.  in [[common law]], the informal black letter legal doctrine includes the basic principles of [[law]] generally accepted by the [[court]]s and/or embodied in the [[statute]]s of a particular [[jurisdiction]]. the letter of the law is its actual implementation, thereby demonstrating that black letter laws are those [[statute]]s, rules, [[acts]], [[laws]], provisions, etc. that are or have been written down, codified, or indicated somewhere in [[legal]] texts throughout history of specific [[state (polity)|state]] law. this is often the case for many [[precedent]]s that have been set in the [[common law]]. an example of such a state within the [[common law jurisdiction]], and using the black letter [[legal doctrine]] is [[canada]]. canada is a [[monarchical state]], with its roots invested in [[colonial england]], and black letter law is the [[principles of law]] accepted by the [[majority of judges]] in most [[provinces]] and [[territories of canada|territories]]. sometimes this is referred to as "[[hornbook law]]" meaning [[treatise]] or textbook, often relied upon as [[authoritative]], competent, and generally accepted in the field of canadian law. in [[legal english|lawyer lingo]], hornbook law or black letter law is a fundamental and well-accepted legal principle that does not require any further explanation, since a hornbook is a primer of basics. law is the rule which establish that a [[principle]], [[provision (law)|provision]], [[references]], [[inference]], [[observation]], etc. may not require further explanation or clarification when the very nature of them shows that they are basic and elementary.  ==similar phrases== the phrase is nearly synonymous with the phrase "[[hornbook law]]". there are a number of  venerable legal sources that distill the common law on various subjects known as [[restatement of the law]]. the specific titles will be "the restatement (first) of contracts" or "the restatement of agency" etc. each of these volumes is divided into sections that begin with a text in boldface that summarizes a basic rule on an aspect of the law of contracts, agency etc. this "restatement" is followed by commentary and examples that expand on the principle stated.

human''''' (1995) is a [[science fiction]] novel by [[k. w. jeter]], and a continuation of both the film ''[[blade runner]]'', and the novel upon which it was based, [[philip k. dick]]'s ''[[do androids dream of electric sheep?]]''  ==plot== beginning several months after the events in ''blade runner'', deckard has retired to an isolated shack outside the city, taking the replicant rachael with him in a tyrell transport container, which slows down the replicant aging process. he is approached by a woman who explains she is sarah tyrell, niece of eldon tyrell, heiress to the entire tyrell corporation and the human template (''templant'') for the rachael replicant. she asks deckard to hunt down the "missing" sixth replicant.  at the same time, the human template for roy batty hires dave holden, the blade runner attacked by leon, to help him hunt down the man he believes is the sixth replicant - deckard.  deckard and holden's investigations lead them to re-visit sebastian, bryant, and john isidore (from the book ''do androids dream of electric sheep?''), learning more about the nature of the blade runners and the replicants.  when deckard, batty, and holden finally clash, batty's inhuman fighting prowess leads holden to believe he has been duped all along and that batty is the sixth replicant; he shoots him.  deckard returns to sarah with his suspicion: there is ''no'' sixth replicant.  sarah, speaking via a remote camera, confesses that she created and maintained the rumor herself, to deliberately discredit and eventually destroy the tyrell corporation, after her uncle eldon created rachael based on her and then abandoned the real sarah.  sarah brings rachael back to the corporation building to meet with deckard, and he escapes with her.  however, holden - recovering from his injuries during the fight - later finds the truth: rachael has been killed by tyrell agents, and the "rachael" who escaped with deckard was actually sarah.  she has completed her revenge by both destroying tyrell, and taking back rachael's place.  ==characters== *rick deckard: the tyrell corporation finally locates him, residing at a cabin in the woods with the frozen rachael. in exchange for getting rachael back, deckard agrees to hunt the missing sixth replicant. *roy batty: the man which tyrell used as the template for his combat replicants is in fact a man of considerable instability, suffering from a brain disorder that prevents him from experiencing fear. *sarah tyrell: the niece of eldon tyrell, sarah locates and hires deckard to eliminate the final replicant in order to retain her corporation's hold over the market. *dave holden: starting off bed-ridden after his attack by the replicant leon, holden is rescued by roy who in turn leads him to some startling revelations. *j.r. isidore: a lowly employee of a vet's office, isidore also works as an underground replicant sympathizer, having made modifications to replicants in order to help them escape detection.  ==relationship to other works== the book's plot draws from other material related to ''blade runner'' in a number of ways: * deckard, pris, sebastian, leon, batty, and holden all appeared in ''blade runner''. * many of the parts of the "conspiracy" are based on errors or plot holes identified by fans of the original movie, such as leon's ability to bring a gun into the tyrell building, or the reference to the sixth replicant. * the character of john isidore, and his "pet hospital", is taken from dick's original novel ''[[do androids dream of electric sheep?]]'', although that book contained no suggestion that the shop ran a sideline in modifying replicants. * ''blade runner''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sebastian was based on ''electric sheep''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s isidore, though jeter features them as separate characters in ''the edge of human''. * the idea of replicant models being mass-produced, and in particular a woman identical to rachael existing, is also from ''do androids dream of electric sheep?''; although in that book, pris was the replicant double of rachael, and there was no suggestion that replicants were constructed based on human templates. * the etymology of the term "blade runner" is revealed to come from the german phrase ''bleib ruhig'', meaning "remain calm." it was supposedly developed by the tyrell corporation to prevent news about replicants malfunctioning.  however, it also contradicts material in some ways: * sebastian was stated as being dead in the movie, yet he is alive in ''the edge of human''. * pris was clearly stated as being a replicant in both the movie and the original novel, yet ''the edge of human'' claims she was human. * pris was clearly destroyed by deckard in both the movie and the original novel. sebastian's ability to bring pris back to life as a replicant introduces numerous problems: the book implies that sebastian somehow was able to do this without realising that her original body was human. it is likewise unclear why deckard would have left her, or any suspected replicant he retired, in a state from which they could be repaired. * "the final cut" of ''blade runner'' removed the reference of a surviving sixth replicant, as it was normally considered a leftover from an early script.  ==reception== michael giltz of ''[[entertainment weekly]]'' gave the book a "c-", feeling that "only hardcore fans will be satisfied by this tale" and saying that jeter's "habit of echoing dialogue and scenes from the film is annoying and begs comparisons he would do well to avoid."<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299536,00.html review] michael giltz, ''entertainment weekly'', nov 17, 1995</ref> tal cohen of ''tal cohen's bookshelf'' called ''the edge of human'' "a good book", praising jeter's "further, and deeper, investigation of the questions philip k. dick originally asked", but criticized the book for its "needless grandioseness" and for "rel[ying] on ''blade runner'' too heavily, [as] the number of new characters introduced is extremely small..."<ref>[http://tal.forum2.org/br2 review] tal cohen, ''tal cohen's bookshelf'', 28 august 1999</ref>  ian

{{refimprove|date=august 2015}}  different cultures through history have depicted [[blindness]] in a variety of ways; among the [[greeks]], for example, it was a punishment from the gods, for which the afflicted individual was often granted compensation in the form of artistic genius. [[judeo-christian]] [[literature]] positioned blindness as a flaw; only through a cure could god’s love be made manifest, when the scales would fall away from the eyes of an afflicted individual upon contact with a holy man or relic. almost without exception in early literature, blind people could bring this condition down upon themselves through sin or trespasses against the gods, but were never the sole instruments of its reversal.  ==blind people in literature written by visually able authors==   it is impossible to make a blanket generalization about how the blind were treated in literature beyond that point&nbsp;– they were marvelous, gifted, evil, malicious, ignorant, wise, helpless, innocent, or burdensome depending upon who wrote the story&nbsp;– except to say that blindness is perceived to be such a loss that it leaves an indelible mark on a person’s character.  even pioneers in training the blind, such as [[dorothy harrison eustis]], harboured negative stereotypes about them. blind people had, in her opinion, grown so accustomed to waiting on others as to be passive and 'whiney.'  father thomas carroll, who founded the carroll centre for the blind, wrote ''blindness: what it is, what it does and how to live with it'' in 1961. in it, he characterized blindness in terms of 20 losses, and as the 'death' of the sighted individual. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.org/hall/bios/carroll.html|title=american printing house for the blind hall of fame|publisher=www.aph.org}}</ref>  in "moumoku monogatari", [[junichiro tanizaki]] retells the well-known tale of [[oda nobunaga]] and [[toyotomi hideyoshi]] from the perspective of a blind servant. the character is portrayed as demonstrating a number of traditional japanese virtues, but ultimately falls prey to his own human flaws.  "[[the country of the blind]]", a short story by [[h. g. wells]], is one of the most well-known stories featuring blind characters. a sighted man finds himself in a country that has been isolated from the rest of the world for centuries, wherein all the inhabitants are blind even as their ancestors had been. these people are depicted as self-sufficient, having developed their other senses, but they are ultimately closed-minded and insular to the point of [[xenophobia]]. as they themselves have no sight, they wish to deprive the traveler of his own eyes in this allegorical tale of stagnation.  ''[[all the light we cannot see]],'' a [[pulitzer prize for fiction|pulitzer prize]] winning novel by [[anthony doerr]], tells the story of marie-laure leblanc, a young girl who has gone completely blind due to [[cataract|cataracts]] at the age of 6. she keeps her mind sharp with intricate puzzle boxes, which her father carves for her, and [[braille]] novels.  ==literature by blind people== while blind and visually impaired people had contributed to the body of common literature for centuries, one notable example being the author of ''paradise lost'', [[john milton]], the creation of autobiographical materials, or materials specific to blindness, is relatively new.  most people are familiar with [[helen keller]], who was both blind and deaf, but there has been considerable progress since the publication of her work.  * blind author [[tom sullivan (singer)|tom sullivan]] has written several inspirational books, including ''if you could see what i hear'', about his life and accomplishments. * [[jorge luis borges]], who suffered from a congenital condition that caused him to become blind by middle age, discussed his condition in many autobiographical and semi-autobiographical works. * stephen kuusisto wrote about his experiences as a visually impaired person in ''planet of the blind,'' and his upcoming memoir, ''eavesdropping: a life by ear''. * john hull, a university lecturer, wrote about going blind in ''touching the rock: an experience of blindness''. * [[reinmar von zweter]] 13th century german writer of [[gnomic poetry]], featured in the ''[[codex manesse]]''.   * georgina kleege, visually impaired since age 11, wrote about her life and how it was affected by cultural perceptions of blindness in ''sight unseen''. *[[sally hobart alexander]] became blind when she was about 25 and a schoolteacher, during the 1970s, because of an eye disease. she wrote at least three autobiographical books about adapting to blindness. *french author [[jacques lusseyran]], who was visually impaired at the age of 7 when he injured his eyes on the sharp corner of a teacher's desk, became part of the french resistance during world war ii. he spent a year in concentration camps, surviving the experience and writing several books. "and there was light" chronicles his experiences from early childhood until his liberation from a concentration camp.  ==see also== * [[on his blindness]] by [[john milton]] * [[blindness and education]] * [[:category:blindness organizations]] * [[nico (tv series)|''nico'' (also known as ''nicholas'')]], a tv series for educating children about blind people (considering television a sort of literature) *[[thérèse-adèle husson]]  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==external links== *[https://web.archive.org/web/20040417060049/http://www.blind.net/bpba1974.htm blindness: is literature against us?] *[https://archive.is/20040929102431/http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/11870 the country of the blind and other stories, by h. g. wells]  {{defaultsort:blindness in literature}} [[category:blindness|literature]] [[category:topics in literature]]BLM | '''blm''' may refer to:  * [[bergbahn lauterbrunnen-mürren]], a railway line in switzerland * [[biotic ligand model]], toxicology tool * [[black lipid membranes]] * [[black lives matter]], an activist movement * ''[[bleed like me]]'', a 2005 album by garbage * [[blm heliport]] * [[blm (law firm)]] * [[bruno le maire]], french politician and minister of economy and finance * [[bloom syndrome protein]] * [[blue lives matter]], a pro-police movement in the united states * [[braunschweigisches landesmuseum]], a history museum in brunswick, germany * [[bureau of land management]], us federal government agency * [[monmouth executive airport]]'s iata code * [[saint barthélemy]]'s iso 3166-1 alpha-3 country code  {{disambiguation}}BloomfieldLeonard | #redirect [[leonard bloomfield]]Bluegrass | '''bluegrass''' refers to several species of grasses of the genus ''[[poa]]'' (with the most famous being the [[kentucky bluegrass]])  the term has also been applied to various things that relate to the region in which the grass grows: *[[bluegrass region]], a region of the united states centered in kentucky *[[bluegrass music]], a form of american roots music *the blue grass boys, the band led by [[bill monroe]] that defined the bluegrass genre *''[[bluegrass &amp; backroads]]'',  a television show about people and places in the bluegrass region  ;places *[[blue grass, iowa]], united states *[[blue grass, minnesota]], united states *[[blue grass, virginia]], united states  ;other uses *[[blue grass army depot]] in richmond, kentucky *[[bluegrass films]], an independent film studio based in los angeles  *[[bluegrass (sirius)]] *[[bluegrass (train)|''bluegrass'' (train)]], a passenger train of the [[monon railroad]]  {{disambiguation|plant}}Boardgames | #redirect [[board game]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from plural}} }}Body | {{wiktionary|body|body|bodily}} '''body''' or '''body''' may refer to: {{toc right}}  ==in science== ===in physics=== * [[physical body]], an object in physics  ===in life sciences=== * [[human body]], the entire structure of a human organism ** [[dead body]] or cadaver, a dead human body * [[body plan]], the physical features shared by a group of animals  ==in arts and entertainment== ===in film and television=== * [[body (2015 polish film)|''body'' (2015 polish film)]], a 2015 polish film * [[body (2015 american film)|''body'' (2015 american film)]], a 2015 american film * [[body (wonder showzen episode)|"body" (''wonder showzen'' episode)]], a 2006 episode of american sketch comedy television series ''wonder showzen'' * "body", an episode of the adult swim television series, ''[[off the air (tv series)|off the air]]''  ===in literature and publishing=== * [[body (publishing)]], the main part of an article * [[body (typography)]], the size of a piece of metal type * [[b.o.d.y.

[[alma the younger|alma]], who was chief judge, governor, and high priest over the people of nephi, led an army against amlici and his followers and drove the rebellion out of the land.  ====ministry of alma among the nephites==== towards the end of chapter four, alma realizes that the affairs of the church require his entire concentration. he resigns from his political office and appoints [[various book of mormon people#nephihah|nephihah]] as chief judge and governor of the land.  chapters 5-16 record sermons and missionary travels of alma between 83 and 78 bc.  alma and one of his converted followers, amulek, provide important teachings about the atonement of christ, overcoming pride and the natural man, retaining conversion, the resurrection of all men, and judgment day.  later, their teachings about faith and worship in alma 32-34 are important sources of instruction and insight.  ====ministry of the sons of mosiah among the lamanites==== chapters 17 to 27 describe the missionary labors of the sons of [[king mosiah ii]] who was the last king over the people of nephi prior to the peaceful transition of the nation from a monarchy to a republican form of government. the [[sons of mosiah]], named ammon, [[aaron (nephite)|aaron]], [[omner]] and [[himni]], chose to devote themselves to missionary labors preaching to the people of the [[lamanite]] nation, which periodically went to war against the nephite nation. they lived and taught among the lamanites between the years 91 and 77 bc.  ====ministry of alma among the zoramites==== chapters 28 to 35 relate the account of a rebellion of a subgroup of the nephite nation who called themselves [[zoramites]]. the zoramites believed in a form of predestination and taught that all others except their people would be damned. their apostasy from the church was conjoined with plans to rebel against the nephite government. alma took two of his sons, the sons of mosiah, amulek, and [[zeezrom]] on a mission among the zoramites in an attempt to restore their loyalty to both the church and the state.  alma and his companions had some success among the poor class of zoramites who were then exiled from the zoramite community by the governing rich class of zoramites. the wealthier zoramites eventually defected and united with the lamanites.  ====commandments of alma to his children==== chapters 36 to 42 record the teachings of alma to his sons, [[helaman]], [[shiblon]], and [[corianton]]. these teachings discuss the ministry and atonement of [[jesus]], the laws of justice and mercy, the need for repentance, and the resurrection and judgment of all people.  ====period of war==== [[file:moroni - book of mormon.jpg|thumb|400px|captain moroni raises the "title of liberty", as found in the 1910 book ''cities in the sun''.]] chapters 43 to 62 record the struggles of the nephite people during a war against the attacking lamanite nation between the years of 74 and 57 bc. the chief captain (senior military commander) of the nephites during this time was [[captain moroni]]. the nephites were ultimately successful in their defense against the lamanites.  ====conclusion==== chapter 63 includes concluding historical notes covering the years 56 to 53 bc. this is largely a period of post-war reconstruction and exploration in the nephite nation.  ===simple outline===  this outline is based on ''main sections'' and ''[[antagonist]] characters'' in the book of alma. there are two main features in this history, chapters 1 - 42 deal with missionary work, and chapters 43 - 63 contain the wars. the history of the [[zoramites]] provides a transition from missionary work to the war chapters of the book of alma. the two main sections also mirror the first two antagonist characters, nehor (''religious agenda'') and amlici (''political agenda'').  *'''mission chapters''' ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/4/19-20#19 alma 1-42]) **[[nehor]]: rebels against the church ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/1/2,15#2 alma 1]) **[[amlici]]: rebels against the republic ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/2/1 alma 2]) **[[korihor]]: the [[antichrist]] ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/30/12 alma 30]) *'''zoramites''' ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/alma/31/1 alma 31 -

although establishing a cause can be difficult in many cases.  there is almost always a primary lesion elsewhere in the body that must be sought assiduously, because failure to treat the primary

''taenia solium''). organisms that are most frequently associated with brain abscess in patients with [[aids]] are [[poliovirus]], ''toxoplasma gondii'', and ''[[cryptococcus neoformans]]'', though in infection with the latter organism, symptoms of [[meningitis]] generally predominate.  these organisms are associated with certain predisposing conditions:  *sinus and dental infections—aerobic and

initial phase of the inflammation (which is referred to as [[cerebrit]]is), the immature lesion does not have a capsule and it may be difficult to distinguish it from other space-occupying lesions or infarcts of the brain.  within 4–5 days the inflammation and the concomitant dead brain tissue are surrounded with a capsule, which gives the lesion the famous [[ring-enhancing lesion]] appearance on ct examination with contrast (since intravenously applied contrast material can not pass through the capsule, it is collected around the lesion and looks as a ring surrounding the relatively dark lesion). [[lumbar puncture]] procedure, which is performed in many infectious disorders of the central nervous system is contraindicated in this condition (as it is in all space-occupying lesions of the brain) because removing a certain portion of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] may alter the concrete intracranial pressure balances and causes the brain tissue to move across structures within the skull ([[brain herniation]]).  ring enhancement may also be observed in cerebral hemorrhages (bleeding) and some brain [[tumor]]s. however, in the presence of the rapidly progressive course with fever, focal neurologic findings (hemiparesis, aphasia etc.) and signs of increased intracranial pressure, the most likely diagnosis should be the brain abscess.  ==treatment== the treatment includes lowering the increased intracranial pressure and starting intravenous [[antibiotic]]s (and meanwhile identifying the causative organism mainly by blood culture studies).  [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]] (hbo2 or hbot) is indicated as a primary and adjunct treatment which provides four primary functions. firstly, hbot reduces intracranial pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membership.uhms.org/?page=ia|title=home - undersea & hyperbaric medical society|publisher=}}</ref> secondly, high partial pressures of oxygen act as a bactericide and thus inhibits the anaerobic and functionally anaerobic flora common in brain abscess. third, hbot optimizes the immune function thus enhancing the host defense mechanisms and fourth, hbot has been found to be of benefit when brain abscess is concomitant with cranial osteomyleitis.  secondary functions of hbot include increased stem cell production and up-regulation of vegf which aid in the healing and recovery process.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/content/ajpheart/290/4/h1378.full.pdf|title=stem cell mobilization by hyperbaric oxygen|first1=stephen r.|last1=thom|first2=veena m.|last2=bhopale|first3=omaida c.|last3=velazquez|first4=lee j.|last4=goldstein|first5=lynne h.|last5=thom|first6=donald g.|last6=buerk|date=1 april 2006|publisher=|journal=am. j. physiol. heart circ. physiol.|volume=290|issue=4|pages=h1378–1386|via=pubmed|doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00888.2005|pmid=16299259}}</ref>  surgical drainage of the abscess remains part of the standard management of bacterial brain abscesses.  the location and treatment of the primary lesion also crucial, as is the removal of any foreign material (bone, dirt, bullets, and so forth).  there are few exceptions to this rule: ''[[haemophilus influenzae]]'' meningitis is often associated with subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural empyemas.  these effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment.

[[snorri sturluson]] quoted this old poem in ''[[skáldskaparmál]]'', saying that because of this legend heimdall is called "seeker of freyja's necklace" (''skáldskaparmál'', section 8) and loki is called "thief of brísingamen" (''skáldskaparmál'', section 16). a similar story appears in the later ''sörla þáttr'', where heimdallr does not appear.  ===''sörla þáttr''=== [[sörla þáttr]] is a short story in the later and extended version of the ''[[flateyjarbók|saga of olaf tryggvason]]''<ref>the ''[[younger edda]]''.

[[black phoenix alchemy lab]] has a perfumed oil scent named brisingamen.  freyja's necklace brisingamen features prominently in [[betsy tobin]]'s novel ''iceland'', where the necklace is seen to have significant protective powers.  [[j. r. r. tolkien]]'s ''[[the silmarillion]]'' includes a treasure called the [[list of middle-earth objects#nauglamír|nauglamír]], which was made by the dwarves of [[eriador]] for the elvish king [[finrod felagund]]. however, the necklace was brought out a dragon's hoard by [[túrin turambar]] and given to king [[thingol]] of [[doriath]]. this king asks a group of dwarves to set a [[silmaril]] into the necklace for his wife [[melian]] to wear. the dwarves fall under the spell of the silmaril and they claim the nauglamir as their own – with the silmaril attached. they kill thingol and make off with the necklace. it is eventually recovered and is an heirloom of thingol's descendants, eventually leading [[eärendil]] to [[valinor]] and resulting in the return of the [[vala (middle-earth)|valar]] into the affairs of [[middle-earth]]. this is clearly intended to be the equivalent in his mythology to the brísingamen.  in [[christopher paolini]]'s ''[[inheritance cycle]]'', the word "brisingr" means fire. this is probably a distillation of the word ''brisinga''.  [[ursula le guin]]'s short story ''[[semley's necklace]]'', the first part of her novel ''[[rocannon's world]]'', is a retelling of the brisingamen story on an alien planet.   brisingamen is represented as a card in the [[yu-gi-oh! trading card game]], "nordic relic brisingamen".  brisingamen was part of mmorpg [[ragnarok online]] lore, which is ranked as "god item". the game is heavily based from norse mythology.  in the firefly online game, one of the planets of the [[himinbjörg]] system (which features planets named after figures from germanic mythology) is named brisingamen.  it is third from the star, and has moons named freya, beowulf, and [[alberich]].  == references == {{reflist}} {{norse mythology}}  {{defaultsort:brisingamen}} [[category:artifacts in norse mythology]] [[category:torcs]] [[category:mythological objects]] [[category:necklaces]]BryanMcLean | #redirect [[bryan maclean]]BryceCanyon | #redirect [[bryce canyon national park]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from merge}} }}BSDLicense | #redirect [[bsd licenses]]Bse | #redirect [[bse]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from other capitalisation}} }}BuckministerFuller | #redirect [[buckminster fuller]]BuddHa | #redirect [[gautama buddha]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from camelcase}} }}BuddhIsm | #redirect [[buddhism]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from other capitalisation}} }}Bulgarian | {{wiktionary|bulgarian}} '''bulgarian''' may refer to:  * something of, from, or related to the country of [[bulgaria]] * [[bulgarians]], a south slavic ethnic group * [[bulgarian language]], a slavic language * a citizen of bulgaria, see [[demographics of bulgaria]]  * [[bulgarian culture]] * [[bulgarian cuisine]], a representative of the cuisine of southeastern europe  == see also == * {{look from|bulgarian}} * [[list of bulgarians]], include * [[bulgarian name]], names of bulgarians * [[bulgarian umbrella]], an umbrella with a hidden pneumatic mechanism * [[bulgar (disambiguation)]] * [[bulgarian-serbian war (disambiguation)]]  {{disambiguation}} [[category:language and nationality disambiguation pages]]Bulldogging | #redirect [[steer wrestling]]  {{redirect category shell|1= {{r from alternative name}} }}Bundesland | #redirect [[länder]]   {{redirect category shell| {{r from ambiguous page}} {{r to plural}} {{r from alternative name}} }}Bundesrat | '''bundesrat''' is a german word that means ''federal council'' and may refer to: * [[federal council (austria)]] * [[bundesrat of germany]] * [[federal council (switzerland)]] * [[bundesrat (german empire)]]  <!-- long comment to avoid being listed on short pages                                                                                                                                               -->  {{disambiguation}} [[da:forbundsrådet]] [[it:bundesrat]] [[no:forbundsrådet]] [[ru:бундесрат]] [[sv:förbundsrådet]]Bundesregierung | #redirect [[cabinet of germany]]  {{r from alternative language|de|en}}BundesrepublikDeutschland | #redirect [[germany]]  {{redirect category shell| {{r from alternative language|1=de|2=en}} {{r from long name}} }}Bundletheory | {{refimprove|date=september 2009}}  '''bundle theory''', originated by the 18th century scottish philosopher [[david hume]], is the [[ontology|ontological]] theory about [[object (philosophy)|objecthood]] in which an object consists only of a collection (''bundle'') of properties, relations or [[trope (philosophy)|tropes]].  according to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even ''conceive'' of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties.  thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties.  in particular, there is no ''[[substance theory|substance]]'' in which the properties are ''[[inherence|inherent]]''.  ==arguments for the bundle theory== the difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the anglo-american tradition.  the inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a ''bare particular'' (a ''substance'' without properties), an implication that directly opposes [[substance theory]].  the conceptual difficulty of ''bare particulars'' was illustrated by [[john locke]] when he described a ''substance'' by itself, apart from its properties, as ''"something, i know not what. [...] the idea then we have, to which we give the general name substance, being nothing but the supposed, but unknown, support of those qualities we find existing, which we imagine cannot subsist sine re substante, without something to support them, we call that support substantia; which, according to the true import of the word, is, in plain english, standing under or upholding."''<ref>john locke: an essay concerning human understanding (1689), chapter xxiii, of our complex ideas of substances</ref>  whether a ''relation'' of an object is one of its properties may complicate such an argument.  however, the argument concludes that the conceptual challenge of ''bare particulars'' leaves a bundle of properties and nothing more as the only possible conception of an object, thus justifying bundle theory.  ==objections to the bundle theory== objections to bundle theory concern the nature of the ''bundle of properties'', the properties' ''[[wikt:compresence|compresence]]'' relation (the ''togetherness'' relation between those constituent properties), and the impact of language on understanding reality.  ===''compresence'' objection=== bundle theory maintains that properties are ''bundled'' together in a collection without describing how they are tied together. for example, bundle theory regards an apple as red, four inches (100&nbsp;mm) wide, and juicy but lacking an underlying ''substance''. the apple is said to be a ''bundle of properties'' including redness, being four inches (100&nbsp;mm) wide, and juiciness.  critics question how bundle theory accounts for the properties' ''[[wikt:compresence|compresence]]'' (the ''togetherness'' relation between those properties) without an underlying ''substance''. critics also question how any two given properties are determined to be properties of the same object if there is no ''substance'' in which they both ''inhere''.  traditional bundle theory explains the ''compresence'' of properties by defining an object as a collection of properties ''bound'' together. thus, different combinations of properties and relations produce different objects. redness and juiciness, for example, may be found together on top of the table because they are part of a bundle of properties located on the table, one of which is the "looks like an apple" property.  by contrast, [[substance theory]] explains the ''compresence'' of properties by asserting that the properties are found together because it is the ''substance'' that has those properties. in substance theory, a ''substance'' is the thing in which properties ''inhere''. for example, redness and juiciness are found on top of the table because redness and juiciness ''inhere'' in an apple, making the apple red and juicy.  the ''bundle theory of substance'' explains ''compresence''. specifically, it maintains that properties' compresence itself engenders a ''substance''. thus, it determines ''substancehood'' empirically by the ''togetherness'' of properties rather than by a ''bare particular'' or by any other non-empirical underlying strata. the ''bundle theory of substance'' thus rejects the substance theories of [[aristotle]], [[descartes]], and more recently, [[j.p. moreland]], jia hou, joseph bridgman, [[quentin smith]], and others.  ===''language-reality'' objection=== {{original research section|date=may 2012}} the ''language-reality'' objection to bundle theory relates to the impact [[language]] has on understanding [[reality]]. the objection maintains that language causes confusion that supports bundle theory.  per the objection, properties are synthetic constructions of language and thinking alone provides reality to the properties of any object. an apple, it claims, does not have the properties ''red'' or ''juicy'', but rather observers who already believe in a concept called ''red'' use that concept to experience an apple as red. further, the objection maintains that ''red'' cannot be distilled from an apple because ''red'' is an abstraction from other experiences and not an innate property an apple might contain. per the objection, expressions such as, "an apple is red and juicy," includes at least six concepts and would best be left as dead-end logical propositions. since the objection regards the words "red" and "juicy" as simply abstractions of previous experiences, it contends that they contain only a personal summary concept of one individual. thus, the experience of an apple is as close to the ''apple'' concept that one can get. the objection regards any additional analytic work of the mind as a synthesis of other experiences that is incapable of logically revealing any true essence of ''apple''.  the "language-reality" objection asserts that language encourages the belief that "synthetic exercises" distill experiences, yet it rejects the results of such exercises by maintaining that observers actually combine experiences to create each concept of any particular property. it holds that language is a complicated belief system whose only connection to reality is an abstraction of experience. the "language-reality" objection may even suggest that "reality/non-reality" or "objective/subjective" distinctions themselves are merely artifacts of language and therefore are also solely abstractions of experience.{{citation needed|date=august 2010}}  ==bundle theory and buddhism== the buddhist [[madhyamaka]] philosopher, [[chandrakirti]], used the aggregate nature of objects to demonstrate the lack of [[essence]] in what is known as the sevenfold reasoning. in his work, ''[[madhyamakāvatāra|guide to the middle way]]'' ([[sanskrit]]: ''madhyamakāvatāra''), he says:  {{quote|[the self] is like a cart, which is not other than its parts, not non-other, and does not possess them. it is not within its parts, and its parts are not within it. it is not the mere collection, and it is not the shape.<ref>chandrakiri, ''guide to the middle way'', vi.151, translation in ''ocean of nectar'', p. 327</ref>}}  he goes on to explain what is meant by each of these seven assertions, but briefly in a subsequent commentary he explains that the conventions of the world do not exist essentially when closely analyzed, but exist only through being taken for granted, without being subject to scrutiny that searches for an essence within them.  another view of the buddhist theory of the self, especially in early buddhism, is that the buddhist theory is essentially an eliminativist theory. according to this understanding, the self can not be reduced to a bundle because there is nothing that answers to the concept of a self. consequently, the idea of a self must be eliminated.<ref>james giles, ''no self

from the top of a deck, and discarded ("burned"), unused by the players. burn cards are almost always placed face down next to the discard pile without being revealed to the players.  burning is most often performed in [[casino]]s to deter a form of cheating known as [[card marking]]. in [[poker]], for example, the top card of the deck stub is burned at the beginning of each betting round, so that players who might have been able to read markings on that card during the previous round are less able to take advantage of that information. knowledge of a burn card might be marginally useful, such as knowing there is one fewer ace in the deck, but far less so than having it in play.<ref name="faq">[http://www.conjelco.com/faq/burn-card.html what is a burn card and why is it dealt?], rec.gambling.poker faq</ref>  two other uses for burning are: to prevent [[second dealing]] and to provide extra cards for use when an irregularity of play occurs.  sometimes a misdealt card (such as one of the down cards in poker that has flashed during the deal) will be used as the burn card—in those cases, the card should be immediately placed face up on the deck after the deal is complete.  in [[texas hold 'em]] (as well as in [[omaha hold 'em]]), a card is burned before the [[flop (poker)|flop]], before the [[turn (poker)|turn]], and before the [[river (poker)|river]].<ref name="faq" />

a medium-sized [[bird of prey|raptor]].<ref name=crc/><ref name=raptorsworld/>  this broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in europe can be confused with the similar [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''buteo lagopus'') and the distantly related [[european honey buzzard]] (''pernis apivorus''), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from [[northern goshawk]]s.{{citation needed|date=september 2011}} the plumage can vary in britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.  ==behaviour==  the common buzzard breeds in [[woodland]]s, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. it eats mainly small [[mammal]]s, and will come to [[carrion]]. a great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.{{citation needed|date=may 2011}}  buzzards do not normally form [[flocks]], but several may be seen together on [[bird migration|migration]] or in good habitat. the [[victorian era|victorian]] writer on [[dartmoor]], [[william crossing]], noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places.{{citation needed|date=march 2016}} though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately {{convert|30|m|ft}} apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. they are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. pairs mate for life. to attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. this spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. he will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. he then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.  the call is a plaintive ''peea-ay'', similar to a cat's [[cat communication#meow|meow]].  ==status== in parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. in [[ireland]] it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of ireland.  ==steppe buzzard== the steppe buzzard, ''b. (b.) vulpinus'' breeds from east europe eastward to the far east (including eastern china and south asia), excluding japan. it is a long-distance [[bird migration|migrant]], excepting some north [[himalayas|himalayan]] birds, and winters in africa, india and southeastern asia. in the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.  the steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, ''b. vulpinus''. compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller ({{convert|45|–|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long), longer winged and longer tailed. the two colour morphs are the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (''vulpes'' is latin for "fox") and a dark grey form.  the tail of ''b. vulpinus'' is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling north american [[red-tailed hawk]]. the upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in ''b. b. buteo''.  ==gallery== <gallery> file:common

[[miyamoto musashi]], a [[japan|japanese]] swordsman and ''[[ronin]]'', was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords.  in terms of [[firearm]]s and [[handgun]]s, this style has been popularized by [[television]], but is generally denounced by firearm enthusiasts due to its impracticality.{{citation needed|reason=claim regarding firearm enthusiasts likely to be challenged|date=october 2016}} though using two hand guns at a time confers an advantage by allowing more ready ammunition, it is rarely done due to other aspects of weapons handling. dual wielding is present in many films and video games, which have the freedom of ignoring the impracticality of the style. the term itself is often invoked in the context of games.  ==history== dual wielding has not been used or mentioned much in military history, though it appears in [[martial arts#variation and scope|weapon based martial arts]] and [[fencing]] practices.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0pcagaaqbaj|title=schools and masters of fencing: from the middle ages to the eighteenth century|last=castle|first=egerton|date=2012-06-19|publisher=courier corporation|isbn=9780486138756|page=51|language=en}}</ref> this style of combat requires special training, since an untrained user is unable to swing both weapons at the same time. to perform an attack by the defensive weapon after the first, the user needs to perform a separate and distinct action.<ref name="swordfightinstarwars">{{cite book | author=nick jamilla | title=sword fighting in the star wars universe: historical origins, style and philosophy | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g23d4ymmdb0c&pg=pa202 | accessdate=12 june 2013 | date=1 january 2008 | publisher=mcfarland | isbn=978-0-7864-5179-1 | page=257}}</ref> the main advantage of using two weapons is the user can use one as a holding weapon after contact is made and use the other to attack the open area of the opponent. otherwise, there is not much advantage compared to a user who wields a single weapon with both hands in terms of power and control. the latter has more maneuverability due to a more controlled [[center of gravity]]; a person using a single weapon can use their legs for kicking or tripping. a single-handed grip on each weapon also means it can be knocked away with a sufficiently powerful blow.<ref name="swordfightinstarwars"/>  the use of weapon combinations in each hand has been mentioned for close combat in western europe during the [[byzantine]],<ref name="byzantine">{{cite book|author=tim dawson phd|title=byzantine infantryman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o14p5hpv8wac&printsec=frontcover&dq=byzantine+osprey+dawson&hl=en&sa=x&ei=rjjzuz7rbakdiaklp4docq&ved=0cc0q6aewaa#v=onepage&q=byzantine%20osprey%20dawson&f=false|accessdate=12 june 2013|date=7 september 2010|publisher=osprey publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-105-2|page=48}}</ref> [[medieval]], and [[renaissance era]].<ref name="shacklefordspiritofsword">{{cite book|author=steve shackleford|title=spirit of the sword: a celebration of artistry and craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pklamkl09l8c|accessdate=12 june 2013|date=7 september 2010|publisher=adams media|isbn=978-1-4402-1638-1|page=48}}</ref> the use of a [[parrying dagger]] such as a main gauche along with a [[rapier]] is common in historical european martial arts.<ref name="oxford medieval warfare">{{cite book|author=clifford rogers|title=the oxford encyclopaedia of medieval warfare and military technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzwpq6blhhmc|accessdate=12 june 2013|date=june 2010|publisher=oxford university press|isbn=978-0-19-533403-6|page=240}}</ref>  traditional schools of [[japanese martial arts]] include dual wield techniques, particularly a style conceived by [[miyamoto musashi]] involving the [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]], two-sword [[kenjutsu]] techniques he called ''[[niten ichi-ryū]]''.

an '''earned run''' is any [[run (baseball)|run]] that was fully enabled by the offensive team's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team.  conversely, an '''unearned run''' is a [[run (baseball)|run]] that would not have been scored without the aid of an [[error (baseball)|error]] or a [[passed ball]] committed by the defense.    an unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game.  however, it is "unearned" in that it was, in a sense, "given away" by the defensive team.   both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher's [[baseball statistics|statistics]].  however, earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher's [[earned run average]] (era), the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine [[innings pitched]] (i.e., averaged over a regulation game).  thus, in effect, the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs, while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team.   to determine whether a run is earned, the [[official scorer]] must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls.  ==details== if no errors and no passed balls occur during the inning, all runs scored are automatically earned (assigned responsible to the pitcher). also, in some cases, an error can be rendered harmless as the inning progresses. for example, a runner on first base advances to second on a passed ball and the next batter walks. since the runner would now have been at second anyway, the passed ball no longer has any effect on the earned/unearned calculation. on the other hand, a batter/runner may make his entire circuit around the bases without the aid of an error, yet the run would be counted as unearned if an error prevented the third out from being made before he crossed the plate to score.  an error made by the pitcher in fielding at his position is counted the same as an error by any other player.  a run is counted as unearned when:  * a batter reaches base on an error (including catcher's interference) that would have retired the batter except for the error, and later scores a run in that inning by any means. * a batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped by a fielder for an error, extending the at bat, and later scores a run in that inning by any means. in this case, the manner in which the batter reached base becomes irrelevant. * a baserunner remains on base as the result of an error on a fielder's choice play that would put the baserunner out except for the error, and subsequently scores a run in that inning by any means. * a batter reaches first base on a [[passed ball]] (but not a [[wild pitch]]) and subsequently scores by any means. * a baserunner scores by any means after the third out would have been made except for an error other than catcher's interference. * a batter reaches base on a [[fielder's choice]] which removes a baserunner who has reached base safely on an error or has remained on base as the result of an error, reaching first base on a passed ball on a called or swinging third strike, or remained on base on an error on a fielders' choice play that should have retired him, and subsequently scores. * a batter or runner advances one or more bases on an error or passed ball and scores on a play that would otherwise not have provided the opportunity to score.  while the inning is still being played, the second and last scenario can cause a temporary situation where a run has already scored, but its earned/unearned status is not yet certain.  under the last circumstance, for example, with two outs, a runner on [[third baseman|third base]] scores on a passed ball.  for the time being, the run is unearned since the runner ''should'' still be at third. if the batter [[strikeout|strikes out]] to end the inning, it will stay that way.  if the batter gets a [[base hit]], which would have scored the runner anyway, the run now becomes earned.  under the second circumstance, if there are runners on base and a batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped, and then bats in the runners on base through a base hit (including a home run), the runs are unearned for the time being, as the runners should not have advanced. if the results of the remaining at bats in the inning would not have scored the runners, the runs remain unearned. however, if results of subsequent at bats would have scored the runs anyway, the runs would count as earned, unless they only would have scored as a result of a subsequent error or passed ball.  a runner who reaches on [[catcher's interference]] and subsequently scores with two outs scores an unearned run, but baserunners who subsequently score after the runner who has reached on catcher's interference exclusively on clean plays score earned runs; the baserunner  cannot be assumed to have been put out except for the error. (rule 10.16(4)).  neither the use of a [[pinch-runner]] to replace a baserunner who represents an unearned run nor the use of a [[pinch-hitter]] to continue the turn at bat of a batter who would be out except for an error transforms a run scored by such a person or his successors on base from an unearned run to an earned run.  when pitchers are changed in the middle of an inning, and one or more errors have already occurred, it is possible to have a run charged as earned against a specific pitcher, but unearned to the team.  the simplest example is when the defensive team records two outs and makes an error on a play that would have been the third out.  a new pitcher comes into the game, and the next batter hits a [[home run]].  the runner who reached on the error comes around to score, and his run is unearned to both the prior pitcher and the team.  however, the run scored by the batter is counted as earned against the relief pitcher, but unearned to the team (since there should have already been three outs).  had the team not switched pitchers, neither run would be counted as an earned run because that pitcher should have already been out of that inning.  a pitcher who is relieved mid-inning may be charged with earned runs equal to the number of batters who reached base while he was pitching, even if the specific batters he faced do not score.  the batters he put on base may be erased by fielder's choice plays after he has been relieved by another pitcher, but if earned runs are scored in the inning the original pitcher is liable for as many earned runs as the number of batters he put on base.  example: on april 15 2017 justin verlander allowed the first two cleveland batters in the 5th inning to reach base on base hits; verlander was then relieved by shane greene. greene walked the next batter to load the bases. the next batter hit a grounder and miguel cabrera threw home to force out the runner on third in a fielder's choice, so the bases remained loaded with one out. greene struck out the next batter for the second out. carlos santana then hit a single that scored the runners from second and third (only one of whom was put on base by verlander), and the runner from first was thrown out at the plate to end the inning.  since verlander allowed two batters to reach base he was charged with two earned runs, even though only one of the two specific batters he faced actually scored.   when a pitching change occurs, the new pitcher is said to "[[list of baseball jargon (i)#inherited runner|inherit]]" any runners that are on base at the time, and if they later score, those runs are charged (earned or unearned) to the prior pitcher.  most [[box score (baseball)|box scores]] now list inherited runners, and the number that scored, as a statistic for the relief pitcher.     ==external links== *[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_rules.jsp major league baseball official rules]  ==see also== *[[baseball statistics]] *[[earned run average]] *[[run average]]  {{baseball statistics}}  {{defaultsort:earned run}} [[category:baseball terminology]] [[category:pitching statistics]]  [[it:media pgl]]EconomyofAmericanSamoa | {{use dmy dates|date=july 2013}} {{unreferenced|date=february 2011}} {{infobox economy |country = american samoa |image = dollarbill4.jpg |width = 290px |currency = [[united states dollar|us dollar]] (usd) |year = 1 october - 30 september |organs = none |gdp rank = [[list of countries by gdp (nominal)|187th]] (nominal) / [[list of countries by gdp (ppp)|190th]] (ppp) |gdp = $537 million (2007 est) |growth = 3% (2003) |per capita = $7,874 (2008) |sectors = na |inflation = na |poverty = na |labor = 17,630 (2007) |occupations = agriculture 34%, industry 33%, services 33% (1990) |unemployment = 23.8% (2010) |industries = tuna canneries (largely dependent on foreign fishing vessels), handicrafts |exports = $445.6 million (2004) |export-goods = canned tuna 93% (2004) |export-partners = [[indonesia]] 70%, australia 6.7%, japan 6.7%, [[samoa]] 6.7% (2002) |imports = $308.8 million (2004) |import-goods = materials for canneries 56%, food 8%, petroleum products 7%, machinery and parts 6% (2004) |import-partners = australia 36.6%, new zealand 20.3%, [[south korea]] 16.3%, [[mauritius]] 4.9% (2002) |debt = na |revenue = $121 million (37% in local revenue and 63% in us grants) (1997) |expenses = $127 million (1997) |aid = more than $40 million from us in financial support (1994) |cianame = aq |spelling = us }} the economy of [[american samoa]] is a traditional [[polynesia]]n economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. economic activity is strongly linked to the united states, with which american samoa conducts the great bulk of its [[foreign trade]]. [[tuna]] [[commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. transfers from the [[federal government of the united states|u.s. federal government]] add substantially to american samoa's economic well-being. attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes.

relies on [[subsistence agriculture]], with only a small fraction directly involved in [[industry]] and [[tertiary sector of industry|services]]. highly variable rainfall, poor [[soil]]s, lack of adequate communications and other [[infrastructure]], a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this landlocked country. the [[export]] economy also remains subject to fluctuations in world prices.  the country has a high population density, few [[natural resource]]s, and a fragile [[soil]]. industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. following the african franc currency devaluation in january 1994 the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. maintenance of its [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.  the burkinabé financial system represents 30% of the country’s gdp and is dominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90% of total financial system assets. eleven banks and five [[non-bank financial institution]]s operate in the country.  the banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding nearly 60% of total financial sector assets. banks are generally adequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the cotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.  as of 2007, the world bank estimated that 26% of the burkinabé population has access to financial services. the central bank of the west african states (bceao) reports that about 41 microfinance institutions (mfis) operate in the country, serving a total of 800,000 customers. burkina faso is a member of the regional bourse regional des valeurs mobilières (brvm) located in abidjan, ivory coast. as of 2009, the regional

a|url=http://www.multicians.org/mga.html|website=multicians.org|accessdate=jan 6, 2016}}</ref>  ==unix archivers== the [[unix]] tools ''[[ar (unix)|ar]]'', ''[[tar (file format)|tar]]'', ''[[cpio]]'' act as archivers but not compressors. users of the unix tools use additional compression tools, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], or [[xz]], to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file. the [[filename extension]]s are successively added at each step of this process. for example, archiving a collection of files with ''tar'' and then compressing the resulting archive file with ''gzip'' results a file with <code>.tar.gz</code> extension.  this approach has two goals: #it follows the [[unix philosophy]] that each program should accomplish a single task to perfection, as opposed to attempting to accomplish everything with one tool. as compression technology progresses, users may use different compression programs without having to modify or abandon their archiver. #the archives use [[solid compression]]. when the files are combined, the compressor can exploit redundancy across several archived files and achieve better compression than a compressor that compresses each files individually.  this approach, however, has disadvantages too: #extracting or modifying one file is difficult. extracting one file requires decompressing an entire archive, which can be time- and space-consuming. modifying one means the file needs to be put back into archive and the archive recompressed again. this operation requires additional time and disk space. #the archive becomes damage-prone. if the area holding shared data for several files is damaged, all those files are lost. #it's impossible to take advantage of redundancy between files unless the compression window is larger than the size of an individual file. for example, gzip uses [[deflate]], which typically operates with a 32768 byte window, whereas bzip2 uses a [[burrows-wheeler transform]] roughly 27 times bigger. xz defaults to 8 mib but supports significantly larger windows.  ==windows archivers== the built-in archiver of [[microsoft windows]] as well as third-party archiving software, such as [[winrar]] and [[7-zip]], often use a [[graphical user interface]]. they also offer an optional [[command-line interface]], while windows itself does not. windows archivers perform both archiving and compression. [[solid compression]] may or may not be offered, depending on the product: windows itself does not support it; winrar and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.  == see also == * [[comparison of file archivers]] * [[archive format]] * [[list of archive formats]] * [[comparison of archive formats]]  ==references== {{reflist}}  == external links == * {{dmoz|computers/data_formats/archive/|archive formats}}  {{defaultsort:file archiver}} [[category:storage systems]] [[category:computer file systems]] [[category:computer archives]] [[category:file archivers| ]] [[category:utility software types]]ForeignrelationsofBurundi | {{refimprove|date=november 2014}} {{politics of burundi}} [[burundi]]'s relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns. hundreds of thousands of burundian [[refugee]]s have at various times crossed to neighboring [[rwanda]], [[tanzania]], and the [[democratic republic of the congo]]. hundreds of thousands of burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war. most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in tanzania. some burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities. the 1993 embargo placed on burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors;

either colonial administration solely (such as the [[executive council (commonwealth countries)|executive council]]), or a mixture of colonial rule and a partially elected assembly, such as the [[legislative council of barbados|legislative council]].     since independence the [[barbados labour party]] (blp) governed from 1976 to 1986, and from september 1994 – 2008. the [[democratic labour

legislate for barbados, but the existing english and british common law and statutes in force at that time, together with other measures already adopted by the [[barbadian parliament]], became the basis of the new country's legal system.  legislation may be shaped or influenced by such organisations as the united nations, the [[organization of american states]], or other international bodies to which barbados has obligatory commitments by treaty. additionally, through international co-operation, other institutions may supply the barbados parliament with key sample legislation to be adapted to meet local circumstances before enacting it as local law.  new acts are passed by the barbadian parliament and require [[royal assent]] by the governor-general to become law.  ==judicial branch ==

wilhelm hermann kolbe'', 27 september 1818 – 25 november 1884), was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern [[organic chemistry]]. he was a professor at [[university of marburg|marburg]] and [[leipzig university|leipzig]]. kolbe coined the term [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] and contributed to the philosophical demise of [[vitalism]] through synthesis of the [[organic chemical|organic substance]] acetic acid from [[carbon disulfide]], and also contributed to the development of [[structural theory]]. this was done via modifications to the idea of "radicals" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his [[kolbe electrolysis]] of carboxylate salts, the [[kolbe-schmitt reaction]] in the preparation of [[aspirin]] and the [[kolbe nitrile synthesis]]. after studies with [[friedrich wöhler|wöhler]] and [[robert bunsen|bunsen]], kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in london (with [[edward frankland|frankland]]), and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the [[:de:journal für praktische chemie|''journal für praktische chemie'']]. as such, he was elected to the royal swedish academy of sciences  won the [[royal society of london]]'s davy medal in the year of his death. despite these accomplishments and his training, by a storied next generation of chemists (including [[aleksandr mikhailovich zaitsev|zaitsev]], [[theodor curtius|curtius]], [[ernst otto beckmann|beckmann]], [[carl graebe|graebe]], [[vladimir markovnikov|markovnikov]], etc.), kolbe is remembered for editing the ''journal'' for more than a decade, where his rejection of [[august kekulé|kekulé]]'s structure of benzene, [[jacobus henricus van 't hoff|van't hoff]]'s theory on the origin of [[chirality]] and [[adolf von baeyer|von baeyer]]'s reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent. kolbe died of a heart attack in [[leipzig]] at age 68, six years after the death of his wife, charlotte. he was survived by four children.  ==life==  kolbe was born in elliehausen, near [[göttingen]], [[kingdom of hanover]] (germany) as the eldest son of a [[protestant]] pastor. at the age of 13, he entered the göttingen gymnasium, residing at the home of one of the professors.  he obtained the leaving certificate (the [[abitur]]) six years later.  he had become passionate about the study of [[chemistry]], matriculating at the [[university of göttingen]] in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist [[friedrich wöhler]].<ref name=brit1>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/hermann-kolbe | title=hermann kolbe - german chemist |author=alan j. rocke|accessdate=2016-07-28}}</ref>  in 1842, he became an assistant to [[robert bunsen]] at the [[university of marburg|philipps-universität marburg]]. he took his doctoral degree in 1843 at the same university.  a new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to [[lyon playfair, 1st baron playfair|lyon playfair]] at the new ''museum of economic geology'' in london and  a close friend of [[edward frankland]].  from 1847, he was engaged in editing the ''handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten chemie'' (''dictionary of pure and applied chemistry'') edited by [[justus von liebig]], [[wöhler]], and [[johann christian poggendorff]], and he also wrote an important textbook.  in 1851, kolbe succeeded bunsen as professor of chemistry at marburg and, in 1865, he was called to the [[leipzig university|universität leipzig]]. in 1864, he was elected a foreign member of the [[royal swedish academy of sciences]].<ref>{{cite book|last=rocke |first=alan j. | title=the quiet

daughter of general-major wilhelm von bardeleben. his wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage.  they had four children.  ==work in chemical research==  as late as the 1840s, and despite [[wöhler synthesis|friedrich wöhler's synthesis of urea]] in 1828, some chemists still believed in the doctrine of [[vitalism]], according to which a special life-force was necessary to create "organic" (i.e., in its original meaning, biologically derived) compounds. kolbe promoted the idea that [[organic compound]]s could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this "organic" context, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. (hence, while by modern definitions, he was converting one [[organic compound|organic molecule]] to another, by the parlance of his era, he was converting "inorganic"—''anorganisch''—substances into "organic" ones only thought accessible through vital processes.) he validated his theory by converting [[carbon disulfide]] to [[acetic acid]] in several steps (1843–45). kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural [[radical theory|radicals]], so contributing to the development of [[structural theory]]. a dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary [[alcohol]]s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. kolbe was the first person to use the word [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] in its present-day meaning, and contributed a number of new chemical reactions.<ref name=brit1 />  in particular, kolbe developed procedures for the [[electrolysis]] of the salts of [[fatty acid|fatty]] and other [[carboxylic acid]]s ([[kolbe electrolysis]])<ref>{{cite journal|title = untersuchungen über die elektrolyse organischer verbindungen| author = hermann kolbe| journal = [[annalen der chemie und pharmacie]]| year = 1849| volume = 69| issue = 3| pages = 257–372| doi = 10.1002/jlac.18490690302}}{{primary source inline|date=july 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=lindsey|first=alan|last2=jeskey|first2=harold|date=1957|title=the kolbe schmitt reaction|journal=chem review|volume=}}</ref> and prepared [[salicylic acid]], a building block of [[aspirin]] in a process called [[kolbe synthesis]] or [[kolbe-schmitt reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = ueber synthese der salicylsäure| author = hermann kolbe| journal = [[annalen der chemie und pharmacie]]| year = 1860| volume = 113| issue = 1| pages = 125–127| doi = 10.1002/jlac.18601130120}}</ref><ref name=ksr1>{{cite web|url=http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/kolbe-schmitt-reaction.shtm|title=kolbe-schmitt reaction|accessdate=2016-07-28}}</ref> his method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the [[kolbe nitrile synthesis]],[https://books.google.ca/books?id=4tbwg3diykqc&pg=pa537&lpg=pa537&dq=kolbe+nitrile+synthesis+detailed+explanation&source=bl&ots=x-qzme85h1&sig=agjsca0yjpofedbodsj0voskjhc&hl=en&sa=x&ved=0ahukewje8bzsnprqahvmzomkhe1zbqaq6aeilzad#v=onepage&q=kolbe%20nitrile%] and with [[edward frankland]] he found that [[nitrile]]s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids.<ref name=kns1>{{cite web|url=http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/kolbe-nitrile-synthesis.shtm|title=kolbe nitrile synthesis|accessdate=2016-07-28}}</ref> in addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work, kolbe oversaw student research at leipzig and especially at marburg;

if he is put out while attempting to stretch his hit to a [[double (baseball)|double]] or [[triple (baseball)|triple]] or home run on the same play, he still gets credit for a hit (according to the last base he reached safely on the play).  if a batter reaches first base because of offensive interference by a preceding runner (including if a preceding runner is hit by a batted ball), he is also credited with a hit.  ===types of hits=== a hit for one base is called a [[single (baseball)|single]], for two bases a [[double (baseball)|double]], and for three bases a [[triple (baseball)|triple]].  a [[home run]] is also scored as a hit.  doubles, triples, and home runs are also called [[extra base hit]]s.  an "[[infield hit]]" is a hit where the ball does not leave the infield.  infield hits are uncommon by nature, and most often earned by speedy runners.  ==pitching a no-hitter== a [[no-hitter]] is a game in which one of the teams prevented the other from getting a hit. throwing a no-hitter is rare and considered an extraordinary accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff. in most cases in the professional game, no-hitters are accomplished by a single pitcher who throws a complete game.  a pitcher who throws a no-hitter could still allow runners to reach base safely, by way of [[base on balls|walk]]s, [[error (baseball)|error]]s, [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]], or batter reaching base due to interference or obstruction.  if the pitcher allows no runners to reach base in any manner whatsoever (hit, walk, hit batsman, error, etc.), the no-hitter is a [[perfect game]].  ==history== [[image:tycobbtigers.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[ty cobb]] recorded a career 4,191 hits, holding the major league record for 57 years.]] in [[1887 in baseball|1887]], [[major league baseball]] counted [[base on balls|bases on balls]] (walks) as hits. the result was skyrocketing [[batting average]]s, including some near .500; [[tip o'neill (baseball)|tip o'neill]] of the [[st. louis browns (nl)|st. louis browns]] batted .485 that season, which would still be a major league record if recognized. the experiment was abandoned the following season.  there is controversy regarding how the records of 1887 should be interpreted. the number of legitimate walks and at-bats are known for all players that year, so computing averages using the same method as in other years is straightforward. in 1968, major league baseball formed a special baseball records committee to resolve this (and other) issues.  the committee ruled that walks in 1887 should not be counted as hits.  in 2000, major league baseball reversed its decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. most current sources list o'neill's 1887 average as .435, as calculated by omitting his walks.  he would retain his [[american association (19th century)|american association]] batting championship. however, the variance between methods results in differing recognition for the 1887 [[national league]] batting champion.  [[cap anson]] would be recognized, with his .421 average, if walks are included, but [[sam thompson]] would be the champion at .372 if they are not.  ==major league baseball rules== the official rulebook of [[major league baseball]] states in rule 10.05:<ref>http://www.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp</ref> ::(a) the official scorer shall credit a batter with a base hit when: :(1) the batter reaches first base (or any succeeding base) safely on a fair ball that settles on the ground, that touches a fence before being touched by a fielder or that clears a fence; :(2) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball hit with such force, or so slowly, that any fielder attempting to make a play with the ball has no opportunity to do so; ::rule 10.05(a)(2) comment: the official scorer shall credit a hit if the fielder attempting to handle the ball cannot make a play, even if such fielder deflects the ball from or cuts off another fielder who could have put out a runner. :(3) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that takes an unnatural bounce so that a fielder cannot handle it with ordinary effort, or that touches the pitcher's plate or any base (including home plate) before being touched by a fielder and bounces so that a fielder cannot handle the ball with ordinary effort; :(4) the batter reaches first base safely on a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder and that is in fair territory when the ball reaches the outfield, unless in the scorer's judgment the ball could have been handled with ordinary effort; :(5) a fair ball that has not been touched by a fielder touches a runner or an umpire, unless a runner is called out for having been touched by an infield fly, in which case the official scorer shall not score a hit; or :(6) a fielder unsuccessfully attempts to put out a preceding runner and, in the official scorer's judgment, the batter-runner would not have been put out at first base by ordinary effort. rule 10.05(a) comment: in applying rule 10.05(a), the official scorer shall always give the batter the benefit of the doubt. a safe course for the official scorer to follow is to score a hit when exceptionally good fielding of a ball fails to result in a putout.  ::(b) the official scorer shall not credit a base hit when a: :(1) runner is forced out by a batted ball, or would have been forced out except for a fielding error;

[[catherine ii of russia|catherine the great]], empress of russia from 1762–1796, was a member of the house of ascania, herself the daughter of [[christian august, prince of anhalt-zerbst]].  ==list of states ruled by the house of ascania== {{ducal family of anhalt}} * county, principality, and duchy of [[principality of anhalt|anhalt]]: c. 1100–1918 * [[duchy of saxony|duchy]] and [[electorate of saxony]]: 1112, 1139–1142, 1180–1422 * county of [[weimar-orlamünde]]: 1112–1486 * [[margravate of brandenburg]]: 1157–1320 * [[duchy of saxe-lauenburg]]: 1269–1689 * [[principality of lüneburg]]: 1369–1388 * principality and duchy of [[anhalt-bernburg]]: 1252–1468 and 1603–1863 * [[principality of anhalt-zerbst]]: 1252–1396 and 1544–1796 * [[principality of anhalt-aschersleben]]: 1252–1315 * principality and duchy of [[anhalt-köthen]]: 1396–1561 and 1603–1847 * principality and duchy of [[anhalt-dessau]] 1396–1561 and 1603–1863 * [[principality of anhalt-plötzkau]] 1544–1553 and 1603–1665 * principality of [[anhalt-harzgerode]] 1635–1709 * principality of anhalt-mühlingen: 1667–1714 * [[principality of anhalt-dornburg]]: 1667–1742 * principality of [[anhalt-bernburg-schaumburg-hoym]]: 1718–1812 * [[russian empire]]: 1762–1796  ==references== * [http://susi.e-technik.uni-ulm.de:8080/meyers2/seite/werk/brockhaus/band/50/seite/0992/brockhaus_b50_s0992.html ''askanien'', meyers konversationslexikon, 1888] * trillmich, werner, ''kaiser konrad ii. und seine zeit'', bonn, 1991  ==external links== {{commonscat|house of ascania}} *[http://www.anhalt-askanien.de/ ducal family of anhalt (house of ascania)]] - official website *{{cite web |last=marek |first=miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/ascania/ascan1.html |title= genealogy.eu: house of ascania |publisher= genealogy.eu}} (first page of a series) *[http://www.stirnet.com/genie/data/continent/bb/brandenburg1.php#top stirnet: brandenburg1] {{subscription required}} (genealogy of the houses of ascania and brandenburg, including the most likely ancestry of the 11th-century house of ascania) *[http://www.stirnet.com/genie/data/ancient/ae/ascania1.php#top stirnet: ascania1] {{subscription required}} (an alternate possible ancestry of the 11th-century house of ascania)   {{royal houses of europe}}  {{authority control}}  {{defaultsort:ascania, house of}} [[category:house of ascania|*]] [[category:european royal families]] [[category:saxon nobility]]Humanabdomen | #redirect [[abdomen]]  {{wikidata-redirect}}HymntoProserpine | “'''hymn to proserpine'''” is a [[poetry|poem]] by [[algernon charles swinburne]], published in ''[[poems and ballads]]'' in 1866.  the poem is addressed to the [[goddess]] [[proserpina]], the roman equivalent of [[persephone]], but laments the rise of christianity for displacing the pagan goddess and her pantheon.<ref>{{citation |last=louis |first=margot kathleen |date= spring 2005 |title=gods and mysteries: the revival of paganism and the remaking of mythography through the nineteenth century  |journal=victorian studies |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=329–361 |doi=10.1353/vic.2005.0100}}</ref>  the [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] at the beginning of the poem is the phrase ''vicisti, galilaee'', [[latin]] for "you have conquered, o [[galilean]]", the apocryphal [[wikiquote:last words|dying words]] of the emperor [[julian the apostate|julian]].  he had tried to reverse the official endorsement of [[christianity]] by the [[roman empire]].  the poem is cast in the form of a [[lament]] by a person professing the [[paganism]] of [[classical antiquity]] and lamenting its passing, and expresses regret at the rise of [[christianity]].<ref>{{citation |last=eron |first=sarah |year=2003 |title=myth, pattern, and paradox in swinburne's "hymn to proserpine" |publisher=victorian web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/swinburne/eron9.html |accessdate=oct 9, 2013 }}</ref>  lines 35 and 36 express this best:  <blockquote>''thou hast conquered, o pale galilean;

[[wicket-keeper]] [[bert oldfield]]'s skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced off the bat and larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the australian crowd.  the australian press dubbed the tactic ''[[bodyline]]'', and claimed it was a deliberate attempt by the english team to intimidate and injure the australian players. reports of the controversy reaching england at the time described the bowling as ''fast leg theory'', which sounded to many people to be a harmless and well-established tactic. this led to a serious misunderstanding amongst the english public and the [[marylebone cricket club]] - the administrators of english cricket - of the dangers posed by bodyline. the english press and cricket authorities declared the australian protests to be a case of sore losing and "squealing".  it was only with the return of the english team and the subsequent use of bodyline against english players in england by the touring [[west indies cricket team|west indian cricket team]] in 1933 that demonstrated to the country the dangers it posed. the mcc subsequently revised the [[laws of cricket]] to prevent the use of "fast leg theory" tactics in future, also limiting the traditional tactic.  ==see also== * [[bodyline]] * [[off theory]]  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{defaultsort:leg theory}} [[category:cricket captaincy and tactics]] [[category:bowling (cricket)]]lfheimr | {{about|the place in norse mythology|the historical region|álfheimr (region)|other uses|alfheim (disambiguation)}} [[file:ängsälvor - nils blommér 1850.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''meadow elves'', by [[nils blommér]], 1850]]  '''alfheim''' ({{lang-non|álfheimr}}, "land of the elves" or "elfland"), also called '''ljosalfheim''' (''ljósálf[a]heimr'', "home of the [[ljósálfar|light-elves]]"), is one of the [[norse cosmology|nine worlds]] and home of the [[elf#old_norse_texts|light elves]] in [[norse mythology]].  ==in old norse texts== {{also|svartálfaheimr}} álfheim as an abode of the elves is mentioned only twice in [[old norse]] texts.  the [[eddic poem]] ''[[grímnismál]]'' describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza&nbsp;5 with: <blockquote>[[ýdalir]] call they &nbsp; &nbsp; the place where [[ullr|ull]]<br/> a hall for himself hath set;<br/> and álfheim the gods &nbsp; &nbsp; to [[freyr|frey]] once gave<br/> as a tooth-gift in ancient times.</blockquote>  a tooth-gift was a gift given to an [[infant]] on the cutting of the first tooth.  in the 12th century eddic prose ''[[gylfaginning]]'', [[snorri sturluson]] relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven: <blockquote>that which is called álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called ''[[ljósálfar]]'' [light elves]; but the ''[[dökkálfar]]'' [dark elves] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. the light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the dark-elves are blacker than pitch. </blockquote> the account later, in speaking of a hall in the highest heaven called [[gimlé]] that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains: <blockquote>it is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[andlang]] [''andlangr'' 'endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[vídbláin]] [''vídbláinn'' 'wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. but we believe that none but light-elves inhabit these mansions now.</blockquote> it is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to álfheim or distinct. some texts read vindbláin (''vindbláinn'' 'wind-blue') instead of vídbláin.  modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that álfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[völuspá]]''.  ==popular culture== * [[j. r. r. tolkien]] anglicized ''álfheim'' as ''elvenhome'', or ''[[eldamar]]'' in the [[quenya|speech of the elves]]. in his stories, eldamar lies in a coastal region of the [[undying lands]] in the uttermost west. the high king of the elves in the west was [[ingwë]], an echo of the name [[yngvi]] often found as a name for frey, whose abode was in ''álfheim'' according to the ''grímnismál''. * in the japanese light novel and anime series [[sword art online]], the setting for the second and fourth arc is based on álfheimr. * in the japanese game ''[[bayonetta]]'', there are angelic portals called alfheim where the player travels to do specific angel slaying for broken witch hearts or moon pearls to increase vitality or witch power. it does not involve elves, however. only its name is based on norse mythology.  ==see also== * [[fairyland]]  ==references== *''[[wikisource:prose edda/gylfaginning]] (the fooling of gylfe)'' by sturluson, snorri, 13th century edda, in english. accessed apr. 16, 2007 *''gylfaginning'' in old norse<ref>[http://www.germanicmythology.com/proseedda/brodeurprologeandgylfaginning.html gylfaginning xi-xx]</ref> *robbins, rossell hope (1959).

[[natural history]] is the study and description of organisms and natural objects, especially their origins, evolution, and interrelationships.  ==flora== the vegetation of [[africa]] follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture. the northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical. in the countries bordering the [[mediterranean sea|mediterranean]], there are groves of [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[olive]] trees, evergreen [[oak]]s, [[cork oak|cork]] trees and [[pine]]s, intermixed with [[cupressus|cypresses]], [[myrtus|myrtles]], [[arbutus]] and fragrant [[erica|tree-heaths]].  south of the [[atlas mountains|atlas]] range the conditions alter.  the zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness.  characteristic of the [[sahara]] is the [[date palm]], which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, while in the semidesert regions the [[acacia]], from which gum arabic is obtained, is abundant.  the more humid regions have a richer vegetation; dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least, conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts, and in the west african equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper [[nile]]; and [[savanna]] interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus, passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias, etc. forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation. in the coast regions the typical tree is the [[mangrove]], which flourishes wherever the soil is of a [[swamp]] character.  the dense [[forest]]s of west africa contain, in addition to a great variety of [[hardwood]]s, two [[arecaceae|palms]], ''[[elaeis guineensis]]'' (oil palm) and ''[[raphia vinifera]]'' (bamboo palm), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions. ''[[bombax]]'' or silk-cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the india rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as odum (''chlorophora excelsa''), [[ebony]], [[mahogany]] (''khaya senegalensis''), [[oldfieldia]] (''oldfieldia africana'') and [[camwood]] (''baphia nitida''). the climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or "bush" is extremely dense.  in the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or baobab (''[[adansonia digitata]]''), [[hyphaene thebaica|doum palm]] (''hyphaene'') and [[euphorbia]]s. the [[coffee]] plant grows wild in such widely separated places as [[liberia]] and southern [[ethiopia]]. the higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space, as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern [[mediterranean basin|mediterranean]], the [[himalaya]] and [[indo-china]].  in the swamp regions of north-east africa [[papyrus]] and associated plants, including the soft-wooded [[ambach]], flourish in immense quantities, and little else is found in the way of vegetation. south africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of [[kapsia]]s, [[mesembryanthemum]]s, [[aloe]]s and other succulent plants make their appearance. there are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the [[podocarpus|yellow-wood]] (''podocarpus elongatus''), [[stinkwood]] (''ocotea''), [[sneezewood]] or [[cape ebony]] (''pteroxylon utile'') and ironwood. extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. of the grasses of africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the atlas range.  ==fauna== [[image:p l bleyenberghi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|southwest african lion (''panthera leo bleyenberghi'').]] the fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation.  the open savannas are the home of large [[ungulate]]s, especially [[antelope]]s, the [[giraffe]] (peculiar to africa), [[zebra]], [[cape buffalo|buffalo]], wild [[donkey]] and four species of [[rhinoceros]]; and of carnivores, such as the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[hyena]], etc. the [[okapi]] (a genus restricted to africa) is found only in the dense forests of the [[congo river|congo]] basin. [[bear]]s are confined to the atlas region, [[wolf|wolves]] and [[fox]]es to north africa. the [[elephant]] (though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters) is found both in the savannas and forest regions, the latter being otherwise poor in large game, though the special habitat of the [[chimpanzee]] and [[gorilla]]. [[baboon]]s and [[mandrill]]s, with few exceptions, are peculiar to africa. the single-humped [[camel]], as a domestic animal, is especially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes.  the rivers in the tropical zone abound with [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]] and [[crocodile]]s, the former entirely confined to africa. the vast herds of game, formerly so characteristic of many parts of africa, have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior. [[game reserve]]s have, however, been established in [[south africa]], [[british central africa]], [[british east africa]], [[somaliland]], etc., while measures for the protection of wild animals were laid down in an international convention signed in may 1900.  the [[ornithology]] of northern africa presents a close resemblance to that of southern europe, scarcely a species being found which does not also occur in the other countries bordering the mediterranean. among the birds most characteristic of africa are the [[ostrich]] and the [[secretary-bird]]. the ostrich is widely dispersed, but is found chiefly in the [[desert]] and [[steppe]] regions. the secretary-bird is common in the south.  the [[weaver bird]]s and their allies, including the [[long-tailed whydah]]s, are abundant, as are, among game-birds, the [[francolin]] and [[guineafowl]]. many of the smaller birds, such as the [[sunbird]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, the [[parrot]]s and [[kingfisher]]s, as well as the larger [[plantain-eater]]s, are noted for the brilliance of their plumage.  of [[reptile]]s the [[lizard]] and [[chameleon]] are common, and there are a number of venomous [[snake]]s, though these are not so numerous as in other tropical countries.  the [[scorpion]] is abundant. of [[insect]]s africa has many thousand different kinds; of these the [[locust]] is the proverbial scourge of the continent, and the ravages of the [[termite]]s are almost incredible. the spread of [[malaria]] by means of [[mosquito]]es is common. the [[tsetse fly]], whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals, is common in many districts of south and east africa. it is found nowhere outside africa.  ==see also== {{portal|africa}} *[[ecology]]  ==references== * {{1911}}  {{africa topics}}  {{defaultsort:natural history

güell}} {{ipa-ca|ˈparɡ ˈɡweʎ|}}) is a public park system composed of gardens and architectonic elements located on [[carmel hill]], in [[barcelona]], [[catalonia]] ([[spain]]). carmel hill belongs to the mountain range of [[collserola]] – the [[parc del carmel]] is located on the northern face. park güell is located in [[la salut]], a neighborhood in the [[gràcia district]] of barcelona. with urbanization in mind, [[eusebi güell]] assigned the design of the park to [[antoni gaudí]], a renowned architect and the face of [[catalan modernism]]. the park was built between 1900 and 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. in 1984, [[unesco]] declared the park a [[world heritage site]] under "[[works of antoni gaudí]]".<ref name=gaudiunesco>{{citation | title =works of antoni gaudí |publisher = unesco| url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 | accessdate = 15 july 2011}}</ref>  ==description== {{original research|section|date=april 2016}} park güell is the reflection of gaudí's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his [[naturalist]] phase (first decade of the 20th century). during this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. he put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. to that, the catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. in the design of park güell, gaudí unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the [[basilica and expiatory church of the holy family]] (catalan: [[sagrada familia]]).  güell and gaudí conceived this park, situated within a natural park. they imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. they also envisioned a community strongly influenced by [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political [[catalanism]] –  especially in the entrance stairway where the [[catalan countries]] are represented – and from [[catholicism]] – the [[monumento al calvario]], originally designed to be a [[chapel]]. the [[mythological]] elements are so important: apparently güell and gaudí's conception of the park was also inspired by the [[temple of apollo (delphi)|temple of apollo]] of [[delphi]].{{citation needed|date=april 2016}}  on the other hand, many experts{{who|date=april 2016}} have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex [[iconography]] that gaudí applied to the urban project. such references go from political vindication to [[religious]] exaltation, passing through [[mythology]], [[history]] and [[philosophy]]. specifically, many studies claim to see references to [[freemasonry]], despite the deep religious beliefs of both gaudí and [[count güell]]. these references have not been proven in the [[historiography]] of the modern architect. the multiplicity of symbols found in the park güell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and [[puzzles]].  ==origins as a housing development== the park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of count [[eusebi güell]], after whom the park was named. it was inspired by the english [[garden city movement]]; hence the original english name ''park'' (in [[catalan language|catalan]] the name is "parc güell"). the site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called ''muntanya pelada'' (bare mountain). it already included a large country house called larrard house or muntaner de dalt house, and was next to a neighborhood of upper class houses called ''la salut'' (the health). the intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. count eusebi güell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in larrard house. ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by gaudí. one was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, gaudí, at güell's suggestion, bought it

1906 to 1926, was built by francesc berenguer in 1904. it contains original works by gaudí and several of his collaborators. it is now the [[gaudi house museum]] (casa museu gaudí) since 1963. in 1969

distance from the park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. since october 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the monumental zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the park remains free. gaudí's house, "la torre rosa," – containing furniture that he designed – can be only visited for another entrance fee. there is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both gaudí's house and the [[sagrada família]] church.  park güell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. the buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by gaudí. one of these buildings houses a permanent exhibition of the

the focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a [[sea serpent]]. the curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. gaudí incorporated many motifs of [[catalonia|catalan]] nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the park. much of the design of the benches was the work not of gaudí but of his often overlooked collaborator [[josep maria jujol]].<ref>{{cite news

jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. this minimized the intrusion of the roads, and gaudí designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. his structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]] under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his [[church of colònia güell]] so that the [[inverted catenary|inverted catenary arch]] shapes form

house of [[karl alois johann-nepomuk vinzenz, fürst lichnowsky|prince lichnowsky]], to whom they are dedicated.<ref>[http://www.all-about-beethoven.com/trios.html beethoven's trios for string

first published compositions; this  distinction belongs rather to his [[ludwig van beethoven#background and early life|''dressler variations'' for keyboard (woo 63)]]. clearly he recognized these  compositions as the earliest ones he had produced that were substantial enough (and marketable enough) to fill out a first major publication to introduce his style of writing to the musical public.

or he reaches first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]] or is awarded first base (by a [[base on balls]], [[hit by pitch]], or [[catcher's interference]]); or he hits a [[fair ball]] which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (''see also'' [[left on base]], [[fielder's choice]], [[force play]]). in other words, a plate appearance ends when the batter is put out or becomes a runner. a very similar statistic, [[at bat]]s, counts a subset of plate appearances that end under certain circumstances.  == uses == while at bats are used to calculate such important player hitting statistics as [[batting average]]s, [[slugging percentage]]s and [[on-base percentage]]s, plate appearances have no such statistical value. however, at season's end. a player must have accumulated 502 plate appearances during a season to be ranked in any of these categories. for example, suppose player a, with 510 plate appearances and 400 at bats, gets 100 hits during the season and finishes with a .250 batting average. and suppose player b, with 490 plate appearances and 400 at bats, gets 110 hits during the season and finishes the season with a .275 batting average. player b, even though he had the same amount of at bats as player a and even though his batting average is higher, will not be eligible for season-ending rankings because he did not accumulate the required 502 plate appearances, while player a did and therefore will be eligible.<ref>baseball explained by phillip mahony. mcfarland books, 2014. see [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com]</ref>  == rule 10.22(a) == rule 10.22(a) of the [[official baseball rules]] make a single allowance to the minimum requirement of 502 plate appearances. if a player has less than that minimum amount, but if that player would win the batting, slugging or on-base percentage title if he had that minimum amount, then the amount of at bats he is short may be added to his at bat (and hence plate appearance) total so that he may win that title (assuming that his batting average, which would have to be recalculated after these extra at bats were added, would still be the best in his respective league.) for example, in 2012, [[melky cabrera]], then of the [[san francisco giants]], finished the season with a league-high .346 batting average, but he had only 501 plate appearances, one short of the required 502. per the rule, an extra at bat should have been added to his total because, after it is added and his batting average recalculated, he still would have won the batting title. melky's case, however, turned out differently. the reason melky finished the season with only 501 at bats was because he was suspended in mid-august when he tested positive for illegal [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. melky was still eligible for that extra plate appearance, but he requested that that extra plate appearance not be added to his total, and that he not be considered for the batting crown, because he admitted that his use of performance-enhancing drugs had given him an unfair advantage over other players. as a result, melky's name is nowhere to be found on the list of 2012 national league batting leaders.<ref>baseball explained by phillip mahony, mcfarland books 2014. see [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com]</ref>  == calculating == a batter is not charged with a plate appearance if, while batting, a preceding runner is put out on the basepaths for the third out in a way other than by the batter putting the ball into play (i.e., [[pickoff|picked off]], [[caught stealing]]). in this case, the same batter continues his turn batting in the next inning with no [[balls and strikes (baseball)|balls]] or [[strike (baseball)|strikes]] against him.  a batter is not charged with a plate appearance if, while batting, the game ends as the winning run scores from third base on a [[balk]], [[stolen base]], [[wild pitch]] or [[passed ball]].  a batter may or may not be charged with a plate appearance (and possibly at-bat) in the rare instance when he is replaced by a [[pinch hitter]] after having already started his turn at bat. in this case, the pinch hitter would receive the plate appearance (and potential of an at-bat) unless the original batter is replaced when having 2 strikes against him and the pinch hitter subsequently completes the strikeout.  in this case the plate appearance and at-bat are charged to the first batter. (see [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp rule 10.15b])  {{math|pa {{=}} ab + bb + hbp + sh + sf + times reached on defensive interference}}  == other uses == in common terminology, the term "at bat" is sometimes used to mean "plate appearance" (for example, "he fouled off the ball to keep the ''at bat'' alive").  the intent is usually clear from the context, although the term "official at bat" is sometimes used to explicitly refer to an ''at bat'' as distinguished from a ''plate appearance''. however, terms such as ''turn at bat'' or ''time at bat'' are synonymous with ''plate appearance''.  == scoring == section 10 of the official rules states that an at bat is not counted when the player:<ref name="section 10">[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp official rules: 10.00 the official scorer]. mlb.com. retrieved 22 may 2012.</ref> # hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly # is awarded first base on four called balls # is hit by a pitched ball # is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction  the main use of the plate appearance statistic is in determining a player's eligibility for leadership in some offensive statistical categories, notably [[batting average]]; currently, a player must have 3.1 pas per game scheduled to qualify for the batting title (for the 162-game schedule, that means 502 pas).<ref name="section 10"/> also, it is often erroneously cited that total plate appearances is the divisor (i.e., denominator) used in calculating [[on-base percentage]] (obp), an alternative measurement of a player's offensive performance;

[[henry moseley]]'s 1913 experiments (see [[moseley's law]]) provided the necessary evidence to support van den broek's proposal. the effective nuclear charge was found to be consistent with the atomic number (moseley found only one unit of charge difference). this work culminated in the solar-system-like (but quantum-limited) [[bohr model]] of the atom in the same year, in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charges is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells. as thomson's model guided rutherford's experiments, bohr's model guided moseley's research.  ==related scientific problems== the plum pudding model with a single electron was used in part by the physicist [[arthur erich haas]] in 1910 to estimate the numerical value of [[planck's constant]] and the [[bohr radius]] of hydrogen atoms. haas' work estimated these values to within an order of magnitude and preceded the work of [[niels bohr]] by three years. of note, the [[bohr model]] itself only provides substantially-reasonable predictions for [[atom]]ic and [[ion]]ic systems having a single effective electron.  a particularly useful mathematics problem related to the plum pudding model is the optimal distribution of equal point charges on a unit sphere called the [[thomson problem]]. the thomson problem is a natural consequence of the plum pudding model in the absence of its uniform positive background charge.<ref> {{cite journal  |last1=levin |first1=y. |last2=arenzon |first2=j. j.   |year=2003  |title=why charges go to the surface: a generalized thomson problem  |journal=europhys. lett.  |doi=10.1209/epl/i2003-00546-1  |arxiv=cond-mat/0302524  |bibcode = 2003el.....63..415l   |volume=63  |pages=415–418 }}</ref>  the classical electrostatic treatment of electrons confined to spherical [[quantum dot]]s is also similar to their treatment in the plum pudding model.<ref> {{cite journal  |last1=bednarek |first1=s. |last2=szafran |first2=b. |last3=adamowski |first3=j.  |year=1999  |title=many-electron artificial atoms  |journal=phys. rev. b  |doi=10.1103/physrevb.59.13036  |bibcode = 1999phrvb..5913036b   |volume=59  |issue=20  |pages=13036–13042 }}</ref><ref name=lafave> {{cite journal  |last=lafave |first=t., jr.  |year=2013  |title=correspondences between the classical electrostatic thomson problem and atomic electronic structure  |journal=j. electrostatics  |doi=10.1016/j.elstat.2013.10.001   |volume=71  |issue=6  |pages=1029–1035 |arxiv=1403.2591}}</ref> in this classical problem, the quantum dot is modeled as a simple dielectric sphere (in place of a uniform, positively-charged sphere as in the plum pudding model) in which free, or excess, electrons reside. the electrostatic n-electron configurations are found to be exceptionally close to solutions found in the thomson problem with electrons residing at the same radius within the dielectric sphere. notably, the plotted distribution of geometry-dependent energetics has been shown to bear a remarkable resemblance to the distribution of anticipated electron orbitals in natural atoms as arranged on the [[periodic table]] of elements.<ref name=lafave/> of great interest, solutions of the thomson problem exhibit this corresponding energy distribution by comparing the energy of each n-electron solution with the energy of its neighbouring (n-1)-electron solution with one charge at the origin. however, when treated within a dielectric sphere model, the features of the distribution are much more pronounced and provide greater fidelity with respect to electron orbital arrangements in real atoms.<ref> {{cite journal  |last=lafave |first=t., jr.  |year=2014  |title=discrete transformations in the thomson problem  |journal=j. electrostatics  |doi=10.1016/j.elstat.2013.11.007   |volume=72  |issue=1  |pages=39–43  |arxiv=1403.2592}}</ref>  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{atomic models}}  {{defaultsort:plum pudding model}} [[category:history of physics]] [[category:foundational quantum physics]]PoliticsofAngola | {{politics of angola}} since the adoption of a new [[constitution of angola#2010 constitution|constitution in 2010]], the '''politics of angola''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[president of angola]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]].

'''''bust-a-move''''' in north america, is a 1994 [[tile-matching video game|tile-matching]] [[arcade game|arcade]] [[puzzle video game]] for one or two players created by [[taito corporation]]. it is based on taito's popular 1986 arcade game ''[[bubble bobble]]'', featuring characters and themes from that game. its characteristically [[kawaii|cute]] [[anime|japanese animation]] and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.  ==versions== two different versions of the original game were released. ''puzzle bobble'' was originally released in japan only in june 1994 by taito corporation, running on taito's [[taito b system|b system]] hardware (with the preliminary title "bubble buster"). then, 6 months later in december, the international neo geo version of ''puzzle bobble'' was released. it was almost identical aside from being in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] and having some different sound effects and translated text.  when set to the us region, the neo geo version displays the alternative title "bust a move" and features [[winners don't use drugs|anti-drugs]] and [[recycle it, don't trash it!|anti-littering]] messages in the title sequence. the bust-a-move title was used for all subsequent games in the series in the united states and canada, as well as for some (non-taito published) console releases in europe.  ==gameplay== at the start of each round, the rectangular playing arena contains a prearranged pattern of colored "bubbles". (these are actually referred to in the translation as "balls"; however, they were clearly intended to be bubbles, since they pop, and are taken from ''bubble bobble''.) at the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a "pointer", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. the color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen.  the fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the side walls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. if a bubble touches identically-colored bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles—as well as any bubbles hanging from them—are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded.  after every few shots, the "ceiling" of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. the number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colors remaining. the closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over.  the objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. after clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear. the game consists of 32 levels.  ==scoring system== as with many popular arcade games, experienced players (who can complete the game relatively easily) become much more interested in the secondary challenge of obtaining a high score (which involves a lot more skill and strategy). ''puzzle bobble'' caters to this interest very well, featuring an exponential scoring system which allows extremely high scores to be achieved.  "popped" bubbles (that is, bubbles of the same color which disappear) are worth 10 points each. however, ''dropped'' bubbles (that is, bubbles that were hanging from popped bubbles), are worth far more: one dropped bubble scores 20 points; two score 40; three score 80. this figure continues doubling for each bubble dropped, up to 17 or more bubbles which scores 1,310,720 points. it is possible to achieve this maximum on most rounds (sometimes twice or more), resulting in a potential total score of 30 million and beyond.  bonus points are also awarded for completing a round quickly. the maximum 50,000-point bonus is awarded for clearing a round in 5 seconds or less; this bonus then drops down to zero over the next minute, after which no bonus is awarded.  ==two player mode== there are no rounds in the two player game. both players have an arena each (both visible on screen) and an identical arrangement of colored bubbles in each arena. when a player removes a large group (four bubbles or more) some of those removed are transferred to the opponent's arena, usually delaying their efforts to remove all the bubbles from their individual arena. in some versions, the two player game can also be played by one player against a computer opponent.  ==connections with bubble bobble== the characters and theme of the game are based on the 1986 platform arcade game ''bubble bobble''. an arrangement of the original ''bubble bobble'' background music is played in the game's end credits.  the two dinosaurs operating the pointer are called ''bub'' and ''bob'' (or ''bubblun'' and ''bobblun'' in japan). their graphics and animation are based directly on the original ''bubble bobble'', only larger (very similar to [[bubble symphony]] which was released less than a month later). less obvious is the fact that ''puzzle bobble'' also features all the enemies from ''bubble bobble'', which are trapped inside the bubbles and fly out when the bubbles pop. inspecting the bubbles closely, one can see the enemies twitching inside the bubbles.  ==reception== {{video game reviews | egm = 7.8/10 <small>(snes)</small><ref name="egm68"/> | rev1 = ''[[next generation (magazine)|next generation]]'' | rev1score = {{rating|4|5}} <small>(3do)</small><ref name="ngen14"/> }}  reviewing the super nes version, mike weigand of ''[[electronic gaming monthly]]'' called it "a thoroughly enjoyable and incredibly addicting puzzle game". he considered the two player mode the highlight, but also said that the one player mode provides a solid challenge.<ref name="egm68">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=review crew: bust a move|magazine=[[electronic gaming monthly]]|issue=68|publisher=sendai publishing|date=march 1995|page=34}}</ref> ''[[gamepro]]'' gave it a generally negative review, saying it "starts out fun but ultimately lacks intricacy and longevity." they elaborated that in one player mode all the levels feel the same, and that two player matches are over too quickly to build up any excitement. they also criticized the lack of any 3d effects in the graphics.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=proreview: bust-a-move|magazine=[[gamepro]]|issue=69 |publisher=[[international data group|idg]]|date=april 1995|page=68}}</ref>  a reviewer for ''[[next generation (magazine)|next generation]]'', while questioning the continued viability of the action puzzle genre, admitted that the game is "very simple and ''very'' addictive". he remarked that though the 3do version makes no significant additions, none are called for by a game with such simple enjoyment.<ref name="ngen14">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=bust a move|magazine=[[next generation (magazine)|next generation]]|issue=14 |publisher=[[imagine media]] |date=february 1996|page=167}}</ref> ''gamepro''{{'}}s brief review of the 3do version commented, "the move-and-shoot controls are very responsive and the simple visuals and music are well done. this is one puzzler that isn't a bust."<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=quick hits: bust-a-move|magazine=[[gamepro]]|issue=93|publisher=[[international data group|idg]]|date=march 1996|page=72}}</ref>  ==tournaments== puzzle bobble is played at both penny arcade expos, pax east and pax prime. after being the 9-time (7 consecutive years at pax east, 2010-2016, and the 2015-2016 pax prime) undefeated champion, matthew a. tom has declared that he is "retiring from competitive puzzle bobble playing."  == references == <references />  == external links == *{{klov game|id=9169}}  {{bubble bobble series}}  [[category:1994 video games]] [[category:3do interactive multiplayer games]] [[category:arcade games]] [[category:bubble bobble]] [[category:sega game gear games]] [[category:ios games]] [[category:mobile games]] [[category:n-gage games]] [[category:neo geo cd games]] [[category:neo geo games]] [[category:puzzle video games]] [[category:super nintendo entertainment system games]] [[category:taito games]] [[category:windows games]] [[category:wonderswan games]] [[category:xbox 360 live arcade games]]ReligiousdenominationsinPoland | #redirect [[religion in poland]]Romanticorientation | {{sexual orientation}} '''romantic orientation''', also called '''affectional orientation''', indicates the [[sex]] or [[gender]] with which a person is most likely to have a [[romance (love)|romantic relationship]] or [[falling in love|fall in love]]. it is used both alternatively and side-by-side with the term ''[[sexual orientation]]'', and is based on the perspective that [[sexual attraction]] is but a single component of a larger dynamic.<ref>crethar, h. c. & vargas, l. a.

the other is the [[sacrifice hit]] (also known as a sacrifice bunt). but, while a sacrifice fly doesn't affect a player's [[batting average]], it counts as a [[plate appearance]], thus lowering his [[on-base percentage]], and a player on a [[hitting streak]] will have the hit streak end if he has no official at-bats but has a sacrifice fly. the reason for this is that the sacrifice fly, unlike the sacrifice bunt, is not considered a tactical maneuver (players don't try to hit a fly ball to advance a runner). unlike a sacrifice bunt, which may be scored if a runner advances from any base to any base, a sacrifice fly is only credited if a runner scores on the play.  therefore, when a runner on first or second base tags on a fly ball and advances no further than third base, no sacrifice is given and the batter is charged with an at-bat. also, if a runner tags and advances from second base (or, theoretically, from first base) all the way to home and scores (without an intervening error) the batter is credited with a sacrifice fly, as well as a second rbi if a runner on third also scores. at the professional level this will only typically occur in unusual circumstances that prevent the defense from making an immediate throw back to the infield, such as an outfielder colliding with the wall while making a catch on the warning track.   the sacrifice fly is credited even if another runner is put out on appeal for failing to [[tag up]], so long as a run scores prior to the third out.  in the case of a fly ball dropped for an error, the sacrifice fly is only credited if the official scorer believes the run would have scored had the ball been caught.  on any fly ball, a runner can attempt to advance bases right as a fielder touches the ball.  if the fielder bobbles the ball, the runner may still tag up, even before the fielder has full control of the ball (before the fielder is credited with a putout).  the rule works this way because a smart fielder can theoretically purposely bobble the ball and run with it at the same time towards the infield and only completely catch it when he is within a good throwing distance to home plate. as addressed in the official baseball rules,<ref name="official baseball rules"/>  this was put into the baseball rulebook so it prevented these fielders from intentionally bobbling the ball.  ==records== the most sacrifice flies by a team in one game is five;

a [[2 cm flak 30/38/flakvierling#2 cm flakvierling 38|20 mm ''flakvierling'']] quadmount on a [[panzer iv]] chassis.]] larger guns followed on larger trucks, but these mountings generally required off-truck setup in order to unlimber the stabilizing legs these guns needed. one exception to this rule was the italian [[cannone da 90/53]] which was highly effective when mounted on trucks, a fit known as the "''autocannoni da 90/53''". the 90/53 was a feared weapon, notably in the anti-tank role, but only a few hundred had been produced by the time of the armistice in 1943.  other nations tended to work on truck chassis. starting in 1941, the british developed the "en [[portee]]" method of mounting an anti-tank gun (initially a [[2 pounder]]) on a truck. this was to prevent the weapon from being damaged by long-distance towing across rough, stony deserts, and it was intended only to be a carrying method, with the gun unloaded for firing. however, crews tended to fire their weapons from their vehicles for the mobility this method provided, with consequent casualties.<ref name="avalon">''[[advanced squad leader]]'', [[avalon hill]]</ref>   this undoubtedly inspired their morris c9/b (officially the "carrier, sp, 4x4, 40 mm aa"), a bofors 40&nbsp;mm aa gun mounted on a chassis derived from the [[morris c8|morris "quad"]] field artillery tractor truck.<ref name="avalon" /> similar types, based on 3-ton lorries, were produced in britain, canada and australia, and together formed the most numerous self-propelled aa guns in british service.<ref name="avalon" />  the u.s. army brought truck-towed [[bofors 40 mm]] aa guns along with truck-mounted units fitted with mechanized turrets when they sailed, first for great britain and then onto france.  the turrets carried four .50&nbsp;inch (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, which were designed to be adjusted to converge at the single point where enemy aircraft were expected to appear at low altitude in conduction of strafing runs directed at large infantry and field artillery units.  interest in mobile aa turned to heavier vehicles with the mass and stability needed to easily train weapons of all sizes. probably the desire, particularly in german service, for anti-aircraft vehicles to be armoured for their own protection also assisted this trend.  the concept of an armored spaag was pioneered by [[hungary]] during [[world war ii]] by producing the [[40m nimrod]] based on the [[luftvärnskanonvagn l-62 anti ii]] license acquired from [[sweden]]. [[germany]] followed later with their "''flakpanzer''" series. german world war ii spaags include the [[möbelwagen]], [[wirbelwind]], [[ostwind]] and [[kugelblitz]]. other forces followed with designs of their own, notably the american m16 created by mounting [[m45 quadmount|quadruple m2hb browning machine guns]] on a [[m3 half-track]].  the british developed their own spaags throughout the war mounting multiple machine guns and light cannon on various tank and armoured car chassis and by 1943, the [[crusader tank|crusader aa tanks]], which mounted the [[bofors 40 mm]] gun or two-three [[oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]. although used during the normandy landings, by that point german aircraft were contained by the allies own air forces and they were largely unneeded.  ===cold war and later=== [[file:brno, řečkovice, transportér praga v33 ii.jpg|thumb|czechoslovak self-propelled anti-aircraft gun  [[m53/59 praga]] developed in the late 1950s.]] [[file:gepard 1a2 overview.jpg|thumb|[[flakpanzer gepard]], combining radars, fire control and two 35&nbsp;mm guns in a new turret mounted on a surplus leopard chassis.]] [[file:2008 moscow victory day parade - 9k22 tunguska.jpg|thumb|right|typical of more modern designs, the [[tunguska-m1]] mounts both missiles and cannons.]] the introduction of [[jet engine]]s and the subsequent rough doubling of aircraft speeds greatly reduced the effectiveness of the spaag against attack aircraft.{{dubious | date=july 2014}} a typical spaag round might have a muzzle velocity on the order of {{convert|1000|m/s|foot/s}} and might take as long as two to three seconds to reach a target at its maximum range. an aircraft flying at {{convert|1000|km/h|mph}} is moving at a rate of about {{convert|280|m/s|foot/s}}. this means the aircraft will have moved hundreds of meters during the flight time of the shells, greatly complicating the aiming problem to the point where close passes were essentially impossible to aim using manual gunsights. this speed also allowed the aircraft to rapidly fly out of range of the guns; even if the aircraft passes directly over the spaag, it would be within its firing radius for under 30 seconds.  spaag development continued through the early 1950s with ever-larger guns, improving the range and allowing the engagement to take place at longer distances where the crossing angle was smaller and aiming was easier. examples including the 40&nbsp;mm u.s. [[m42 duster]] and the 57&nbsp;mm [[soviet]] [[zsu-57-2]]. however, both were essentially obsolete before they entered service, and found employment solely in the ground-support role. the m42 was introduced to the [[vietnam war]] to counter an expected north vietnamese air offensive, but when this failed to materialize it was used as an effective direct-fire weapon. the zsu-57 found similar use in the [[yugoslav wars]], where its high-angle fire was useful in the mountainous terrain.  by the late 1950s the us army had given up on the spaag concept, considering all gun-based weapons to be useless against modern aircraft. this belief was generally held by many forces, and the anti-aircraft role turned almost exclusively to missile systems. the soviet union remained an outlier, beginning development of a new spaag in 1957, which emerged as the [[zsu-23-4]] in 1965. this system included search-and-track radars, fire control, and automatic gun-laying, greatly increasing its effectiveness against modern targets. the zsu-23 proved very effective when used in concert with sams; the presence of sams forced aircraft to fly low to avoid their radars, placing them within range of the zsus.  the success of the zsu-23 led to a resurgence of spaag development. this was also prompted by the introduction of [[attack helicopter]]s in the 1970s, which could hide behind terrain and then "pop up" for an attack lasting only a few tens of seconds; missiles were ineffective at low altitudes, while the helicopters would often be within range of the guns for a rapid counterattack. notable among these later systems is the [[germany|german]] [[flugabwehrkanonenpanzer gepard|gepard]], the first western spaag to offer performance equal to or better than the zsu. this system was widely copied in various [[nato]] forces.   spaag development continues, with many modern examples often combining both guns and short-range missiles. examples include the soviet/russian [[tunguska-m1]], which supplanted the zsu-23 in service, newer versions of the gepard, and the british [[marksman anti-aircraft system|marksman turret]], which can be used on a wide variety of platforms.  ==see also== * [[man-portable air-defense system]] * [[flakpanzer]], a collective term for german anti-aircraft tanks, particularly those used in world war ii. * [[list of anti-aircraft guns]]  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{authority control}} {{defaultsort:self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon}} [[category:self-propelled anti-aircraft weapons| ]] [[category:armoured fighting vehicles by type]]SoutheastAlaska | [[image:alaska panhandle.png|thumb|250px|southeast alaska and [[alaska marine highway]] ferry routes]] '''southeast alaska''', sometimes referred to as the '''alaska panhandle''', is the southeastern portion of the [[u.s. state]] of [[alaska]], which lies west from the northern half of the [[provinces and territories of canada|canadian province]], [[british columbia]]. the majority of southeast alaska's area is part of the [[tongass national forest]], the united states' largest [[united states national forest|national forest]]. in many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[boundary ranges]] of the [[coast mountains]] (see [[alaska boundary dispute]]). the region is noted for its scenery and mild rainy [[climate]].

all of southeast and ketchikan's [[ketchikan international airport]] serving as a secondary hub for southern southeast alaska. alaska's [[bush aviation|bush airlines ]] and [[air taxi]]s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. many communities are accessible by air only by [[floatplane]], as proper runways are often difficult to construct on the steep island slopes.  ===marine transportation=== southeast alaska is primarily served by the state-run [[alaska marine highway]], which links skagway, haines, [[hoonah, alaska|hoonah]], [[juneau]], [[sitka, alaska|sitka]], [[petersburg, alaska|petersburg]], [[wrangell, alaska|wrangell]], [[ketchikan, alaska|ketchikan]] and other outlying communities with [[prince rupert, bc]] and [[bellingham,

service to the island. a new authority, the rainforest islands ferry authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the north end route. the authority would connect coffman cove with wrangell and petersburg. small companies like sitka-based allen marine and other independent operators in the [[lynn canal]] occasionally also offer marine passenger service. ship traffic in the area is

[[lime (cable & wireless)|''b''mobile]], the cellular arm of cable & wireless, obtained a second.  the third licence was obtained by bvi cable tv, a local cable television service.  the licence in favour of bvi cable was controversial, as the regulator had announced in advance that only three licences in total would be issued, and bvi cable tv had crumbling cable television infrastructure, and was in no position to office cellular telephone services (and to date, has not offered any cellular telephone services, or anything other than simple cable television).  however, ''b''mobile's main regional competitor, [[digicel]], was rejected for a licence.  the decision was regarded as highly controversial in the local media.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2695 bvi platinum news, 23 may 2007] and [http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2782 bvi platinum news, 4 june 2007]</ref>  digicel then issued court proceedings against the regulator, arguing that he had acted improperly by imposing an arbitrary limit of three licences (although interestingly no complaint was made about the decision to prefer bvi cable tv's improbable licence over digicel).

there are a number of systems of '''transport in burundi''', including road and water-based infrastructure, the latter of which makes use of [[lake tanganyika]].  furthermore, there are also some airports in [[burundi]].  a great hindrance to burundi’s economic development is lack of adequate transportation. the country has limited ferry services on lake tanganyika, few road connections to neighboring countries, no rail connections, and only one airport with a paved runway. public transport is extremely limited and private bus companies operate buses on the route to kigali but not to

utility knife, [[puukko]]]] [[file:aaknife2.jpg|thumb|right|retractable blade knife with replaceable utility blade]]  a '''utility knife''' is a knife used for general or utility purposes.<ref name="pet">peterson, harold l., ''daggers and fighting knives of the western world'', london: herbert jenkins ltd., {{isbn|0-486-41743-3}}, p. 1</ref>  the utility knife was originally a fixed blade knife with a cutting edge suitable for general work such as cutting hides and cordage, scraping hides, butchering animals, cleaning fish, and other tasks. craft knives are tools mostly used for crafts.  today, the term "utility knife" also includes small folding or retractable-blade knives suited for use in the modern workplace or in the construction industry.  there is also a [[kitchen knife#utility|utility knife for kitchen use]] which is between a chef's knife and paring knife in size.  ==history== the fixed-blade utility knife was developed some 500,000 years ago, when human ancestors began to make knives made of stone.<ref name="pet"/>  these knives were general-purpose tools, designed for cutting and shaping wooden implements, scraping hides, preparing food, and for other utilitarian purposes.<ref name="pet"/>  by the 19th century the fixed-blade utility knife had evolved into a steel-bladed outdoors field knife capable of butchering game, cutting wood, and preparing campfires and meals.  with the invention of the backspring, pocket-size utility knives were introduced{{when|date=july 2012}} with folding blades and other folding tools designed to increase the utility of the overall design.   the folding pocketknife and utility tool is typified by the ''camper'' or ''boy scout'' pocketknife, the u.s. folding utility knife, the [[swiss army knife]], and by [[multi-tool]]s fitted with knife blades.  the development of stronger locking blade mechanisms for folding knives&mdash;as with the spanish [[navaja]], the [[opinel]], and the [[buck knives|buck 110 folding hunter]]{{citation needed|date=july 2012}}&mdash;significantly increased the utility of such knives when employed for heavy-duty tasks such as preparing game or cutting through dense or tough materials.  ==contemporary utility knives== {{unreferenced section|date=july 2012}} [[file:stanley knife 1.jpg|thumb|right|a stanley 99e utility knife, fully retracted]] the fixed or folding blade utility knife is popular for both indoor and outdoor use.  one of the most popular types of workplace utility knife is the retractable or folding utility knife (also known as a ''stanley knife'', ''box cutter'', ''x-acto knife'', or by various other [[#names|names]]).  these types of utility knives are designed as multi-purpose cutting [[tool]]s for use in a variety of trades and crafts. designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use, utility knives are commonly used in [[factory|factories]], warehouses, construction projects, and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to mark cut lines, trim plastic or wood materials, or to cut tape, cord, strapping, cardboard, or other packaging material.  ==names== in [[british english|british]], [[australian english|australian]] and [[new zealand english]], along with [[dutch language|dutch]] and [[austrian german]], a utility knife frequently used in the construction industry is known as a ''stanley

after [[stanley works]], a manufacturer of such knives. in israel and switzerland, these knives are known as ''japanese knives''. in brazil they are known as ''estiletes'' or ''cortadores [[olfa]]'' (the latter, being another genericised trademark).{{citation needed|date=july 2012}} in portugal and canada they are also known as ''[[x-acto]]'' (yet another [[genericised trademark]]). in india, the philippines, france, italy, egypt, and germany, they are simply called ''cutter''.{{citation needed|date=july 2012}} in the flemish region of belgium it is called ''cuttermes(je)'' (cutter knife). {{citation needed|date=july 2012}} in general spanish, they are known as ''cortaplumas'' (penknife, when it comes to folding blades);{{citation needed|date=july 2012}} in spain, mexico, and costa rica, they are colloquially known as ''cutters''; in argentina and uruguay the segmented fixed-blade knives are known as "trinchetas".{{citation needed|date=july 2012}} in turkey, they are known as ''maket bıçağı'' (which literally translates as ''model knife'').<ref>{{cite web|title=make bıçağı|

knife'', ''sheetrock knife'', or ''drywall knife''.  ==design== utility knives may use fixed, folding, or retractable or replaceable blades, and come in a wide variety of lengths and styles suited to the particular set of tasks they are designed to perform.  thus, an outdoors utility knife suited for camping or hunting might use a broad {{convert|75|to(-)|130|mm|in|sigfig=1}} fixed blade, while a utility knife designed for the construction industry might feature a replaceable utility or razor blade for cutting packaging, cutting shingles, marking cut lines, or scraping paint.  ===fixed blade utility knife=== {{for|the kitchen knife|kitchen knife#utility}} [[file:x-acto-knife.jpg|thumb|right|fixed-blade [[x-acto]] knife for handicrafts and model making.]]  large fixed-blade utility knives are most often employed in an outdoors context, such as fishing, camping, or hunting.  outdoor utility knives typically feature sturdy blades from {{convert|100|to(-)|150|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in length, with edge geometry designed to resist chipping and breakage.  the term "utility knife" may also refer to small fixed-blade knives used for crafts, model-making and other artisanal projects.  these small knives feature light-duty blades best suited for cutting thin, lightweight materials.  the small, thin blade and specialized handle permit cuts requiring a high degree of precision and control.  ===workplace utility knives=== {{unreferenced section|date=july 2012}} [[file:safety cutter and simple box cutter blades extended.jpg|thumb|a modern safety cutter at top, with blunted tip blade and cutting guide/tape hook. at bottom, an older style simple plastic box cutter using standard straight edged blades.]] the largest construction or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades, made of either [[die casting|die-cast metal]] or [[molding (process)|molded plastic]]. some use standard [[razor]] blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades.  the user can adjust how far the blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife can be used to cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. when the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle.  other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray.  the blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.  [[file:box-cutter.jpg|thumb|right|segmented blade or "snap-off blade" utility knife]] another style is a snap-off utility knife that contains a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. as the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. the snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built-in, or a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. when all of the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a replacement blade. this design was introduced by japanese manufacturer [[olfa]] corporation in 1956 as the world's first snap-off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments.  [[file:boxcutter.jpg|thumb|right|inexpensive stamped steel and aluminum box cutter with disposable razor blade.]] another utility knife often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which [[razor#other razors|single-edge utility blades]] can be inserted.  the sleeve slides up and down on the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use.  the blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife.  the blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of [[corrugated fiberboard]], to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.  ==use as weapon== {{see also|airport security repercussions due to the september 11 attacks}} most utility knives are not well suited to use as offensive weapons, with the exception of some outdoor-type utility knives employing longer blades.  however, even small razor-blade type utility knives may sometimes find use as slashing weapons. the [[9/11 commission|9-11 commission]] report stated passengers in cell phone calls reported knives or "box-cutters" were used as weapons, (also mace or a bomb),  in hi-jacking airplanes in the [[september 11 attacks|september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] against the united states, though the exact design of the knives used is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|title=national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united

(these articles, both wikipedia's and nupedia's, are, by the way, free for you to use as you wish, with no fee--see our open content license.)  best regards,  larry sanger  :''see also :'' [[wikipedia:building wikipedia membership|building wikipedia membership]]WikipediaBuildingWikipediamembershipSamplesolicitation3 | {{historical}}  i'm the main organizer of wikipedia, a free, open content encyclopedia. please have a look, at http://www.wikipedia.com/ . i would be delighted if you would link to it from  http://kidspenpals.about.com/cs/dictionaries/  we've got 10,000 articles, growing by 2,000 per month. it's pretty amazing, really. here is an article about it in the mit technology review:  http://www.techreview.com/web/heim/heim090401.asp  we're also soon going to be the subject of an article in the new york times.  thanks!  larry sanger, ph.d. wikipedia chief organizer  :''see also :'' [[wikipedia:building wikipedia membership|building wikipedia membership]]
