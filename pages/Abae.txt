archaeological site]] '''abae''' ({{lang-grc|ἄβαι}}, ''abai'')<ref>{{harvnb|avery|1962|p=1}}</ref> is an ancient town in the northeastern corner of [[phocis]], in [[greece]]. it was famous in antiquity for its [[oracle]] of [[apollo]] [[abaeus]],<ref name="dgrbm">{{harvnb|schmitz|2013|p=1}}</ref> one of those consulted by [[croesus]], king of [[lydia]],<ref name = her>{{harvnb|herodotus|1920|p=53}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|hesychius|schmidt|1867|p=2}}</ref><ref name = p2/> and [[mardonius]], among others.<ref>{{harvnb|bell|1989|p=1}}</ref>  ==history== it was rich in treasures,<ref>{{harvnb|herodotus|2003|p=33}}</ref> but was destroyed by the [[persia]]ns in the invasion of [[xerxes i of persia|xerxes]] in 480 bce, and a second time by the [[boeotia]]ns and remained in a ruined state.it was rebuilt by [[hadrian]].<ref>{{harvnb|smith|2011|p=1}}</ref>  the oracle was, however, still consulted, e.g. by the [[thebes (greece)|thebans]] before [[leuctra]] in 371 bce.<ref name=p2>{{harvnb|pausanias|1898|p=439}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|henderson|2000|p=351}}</ref> the temple, along with the village of the same name, may have escaped destruction during the [[third sacred war]] (355–346 bce), due to the respect given to the inhabitants;<ref>{{harvnb|henderson|2000a|p=381}}</ref> however it was in a very dilapidated state when seen by [[pausanias (geographer)|pausanias]] in the 2nd century ce,<ref name = pausx>{{harvnb|pausanias|1898|p=440}}</ref> though some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, was undertaken by emperor [[hadrian]].<ref name=eb>{{harvnb|hoiberg|2010|p=7}}</ref>  the sanctity of the shrine ensured certain privileges to the people of abae,<ref>{{harvnb|bilco|1882|p=172}}</ref> and these were confirmed by the romans. the persians did not reflect this opinion and would destroy all the temples that they overcame, abae included. the greek pledged to not rebuild them as a memorial of the ravages of the persians.<ref>{{harvnb|henderson|2000a|p=581}}</ref>  among the most exciting recent archaeological discoveries in greece is the recognition that the sanctuary site near the modern village of [[kalapodi]] is not only the site of the oracle of apollon at abai but that it was in constant use for cult practices from early [[helladic period|mycenaean]] times to the roman period. it is thus the first site where the archaeology confirms the continuity of mycenaean and classical greek religion, which has been inferred from the [[list of mycenaean deities|presence of the names]] of classical greek divinities on [[linear b]] texts from [[pylos]] and [[knossos]].{{refn | group = nb |see reports of the excavations of the german archaeological institute in archaeological reports for 2008/9

described below, originally identified as abae by colonel [[william leake]] in the 19th century, is much more likely to be that of the sanctuary of artemis at [[hyampolis]].  the [[polygon]]al walls of the acropolis may still be seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill standing about {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the little plain of [[exarcho]]; one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls below. the temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the town. an early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are a [[stoa]] and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the [[british school at athens]] in 1894, but little was found.  ==notes== {{reflist | group = nb }}  ==footnotes== {{reflist|30em}}  ==references== {{refbegin|2}} * {{cite
