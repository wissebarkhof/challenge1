[[file:marl gerdes.jpg|thumb|[[ludger gerdes]], ''angst'', 1989]]  == music == existential angst makes its appearance in classical [[musical composition]] in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include [[gustav mahler]], [[richard strauss]] (operas ''[[elektra (opera)|elektra]]'' and ''[[salome (opera)|salome]]'', [[claude-achille debussy]] (opera ''[[pelléas et mélisande (opera)|pelleas et melisande]]'', ballet ''[[jeux]]'', other works), [[jean sibelius]] (especially the fourth symphony), [[arnold schoenberg]] ''([[a survivor from warsaw]]'', other works), [[alban berg]], [[francis poulenc]] (opera ''[[dialogues of the carmelites]]''), [[dmitri shostakovich]] (opera ''[[lady macbeth of the mtsensk district (opera)|lady macbeth of the mtsensk district]]'', symphonies and chamber music), [[béla bartók]] (opera ''[[bluebeard's castle]]'', other works), and [[krzysztof penderecki]] (especially ''[[threnody to the victims of hiroshima]]'').   angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over [[cold war|international tensions]] and [[nuclear proliferation]]. [[jeff nuttall]]'s book ''[[bomb culture]]'' (1968) traced angst in popular culture to [[hiroshima]]. dread was expressed in works of [[folk rock]] such as [[bob dylan]]'s ''[[masters of war]]'' (1963) and ''[[a hard rain's a-gonna fall]]''. the term often makes an appearance in reference to [[punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[nu metal]], and works of [[emo]] where expressions of [[depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[existential despair]] or [[nihilism]] predominate.  == see also == {{div col|cols=3}} *[[anger]] *[[byronic hero]] *[[emotion]] *[[existentialism]] *[[kafkaesque]] *[[contrasting and categorization of emotions|list of emotions]] *[[thanatophobia|fear of death]] *''[[sehnsucht]]'' *[[social alienation|alienation]] *''[[sturm und drang]]'' *[[terror management theory]] *[[the mean reds (disambiguation)|the mean reds]] *''[[weltschmerz]]'' {{div col end}}  ==references== <references />  ==external links== *{{wiktionary-inline}}  {{emotion-footer}} {{søren kierkegaard}}  [[category:anxiety]] [[category:emotions]] [[category:existentialist concepts]]
