(the [[western schism]] had begun in 1378, and there were two competing popes at the time, one in avignon supported by france and spain, and one in rome, supported by most of italy, germany and england.) in 1386 he is listed as canon of the cathedral of bologna. in 1396, he became archdeacon in bologna. he became [[cardinal (catholicism)#cardinal deacon|cardinal deacon]] of saint eustachius in 1402 and [[papal legate]] in [[romagna]] in 1403.
