[consist of an] open...reading [of] the [[indictment]]...to the defendant...and call[] on him to plead thereto. he/she shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he/she is called upon to plead."<ref>{{frcrp|10}}</ref>  in federal courts, arraignment takes place in two stages. the first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until monday.<ref>{{cite book |title=criminal procedure |publisher=thomson wadsworth |year=2012 |edition=8th |first=joel |last=samaha |isbn=978-0-495-91335-1 }}</ref> during this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. the presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set [[bail]]. during the second arraignment, a post-indictment arraignment or pia, the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.  in new york, most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours.<ref>{{cite news|title=ruling forces new york to release or arraign suspects in 24 hours|first=kevin|last=sack|work=[[the new

conducted without unnecessary delay and, in any event, within 48 hours of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays.<ref name=riverside>[[county of riverside v. mclaughlin]], 500 u.s. 44 (1991)</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=california basic practice handbook|date=november 2016|publisher=regents of the university of california|isbn=9780762624676|page=6-11|accessdate=18 july 2017}}</ref> thus, an individual arrested without a warrant, in some cases, may be held for as long as 168 hours (7 days) without arraignment or charge.<ref name=riverside/>  ==form of the arraignment== the wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.<ref>in some jurisdictions the wording of the arraignment is set by statute or court practice direction.</ref>  however, it generally conforms with the following principles: # the accused person ([[defendant]]) is addressed by [[name]]; # the [[criminal charge|charge]] against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offense (and sometimes the names of the state's witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge(s)); and, # the accused person is asked formally how he or she [[plea]]ds.  ==video arraignment== '''video arraignment''' is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of [[videoconferencing]] technology. use of video arraignment system allows the [[court]]s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the [[courtroom]] by using an [[audio-visual]] link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.  use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. the transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. it also addresses the rising costs of transportation.  ==guilty and not-guilty pleas== if the defendant pleads guilty, an [[preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. the court is not required to accept a guilty plea. during the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character, and passes [[sentence (law)|sentence]].  if the defendant pleads [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]], a date is set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or a [[trial]].  in the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or "stood mute") was subject to [[peine forte et dure]] ([[law french]] for "strong and hard punishment"). today in [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.<ref>in queensland, australia, this matter is covered by statute. see s601 of the queensland [[criminal code]].</ref> the rationale for this is the defendant's [[right to silence]].  ==pre-trial release== this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.  ==see also== *[[desk appearance ticket]]  ==references== {{reflist}}
