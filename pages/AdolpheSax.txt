continued to make conventional instruments to bring in money. adolphe's first important invention was an improvement of the [[bass clarinet]] design, which he patented at the age of 24. sax relocated permanently to [[paris]] in 1841 and began working on a new set of instruments which he exhibited there in 1844. these were valved [[bugle (instrument)|bugles]], and although he had not invented the instrument itself, his examples were much more successful than those of his rivals and became known as [[saxhorn]]s. they came in seven different sizes, and paved the way for the creation of the [[flugelhorn]]. today, saxhorns are sometimes used in [[concert band]]s and [[orchestra]]s. the saxhorn also laid the groundwork for the modern [[euphonium]].  sax also developed the ''[[saxotromba]]'' family, valved brass instruments with narrower bore than the saxhorns, in 1845, though they survived only briefly.<ref name=hubbard-encycl>{{cite book | last = hubbard |first = w.

largely unchanged today. the advances made by adolphe sax were soon followed by the [[brass band (british style)|british brass band]] movement which exclusively adopted the saxhorn family of instruments. the jedforest instrumental band formed in 1854 and the hawick saxhorn band formed in 1855, within the [[scottish borders]], a decade after saxhorn models became available.  the period around 1840 saw sax inventing the ''clarinette-bourdon'', an early unsuccessful design of [[contrabass clarinet]]. around this time he also developed the instrument for which he is best known: the [[saxophone]] which he patented on 28 june 1846. the saxophone was invented for use in both orchestras and military bands. by 1846 sax had designed (on paper at least) a full range of saxophones (from [[sopranino saxophone|sopranino]] to [[subcontrabass saxophone|subcontrabass]]). composer [[hector berlioz]] wrote approvingly of the new instrument in 1842, but despite his support, saxophones never became standard orchestral instruments. however, their ability to play technical passages easily like [[woodwind instruments |woodwinds]] and also project loudly like [[brass instruments]] led them to be included in [[military bands]] in france and elsewhere. the saxophone was sax's signature accomplishment and created his reputation more than any other. this helped secure him a job teaching at the [[paris conservatory]] in 1857.<ref name=hemke>[[frederick hemke|fred l. hemke]], ''the early history of the saxophone'', ([[doctor of musical arts]] (dma) dissertation), university of wisconsin,

makers both attacked the legitimacy of his patents and were sued by sax for patent infringement. the legal back-and-forth continued for over 20 years. he was driven into bankruptcy twice: in 1856 and again in 1873.  sax suffered from lip cancer between 1853 and 1858 but made a full recovery. in 1894 sax died in complete poverty<ref>{{cite news|title=adolphe sax
