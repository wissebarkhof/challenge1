'''alcidamas''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἀλκιδάμας}}), of [[elaea (aeolis)|elaea]], in [[aeolis]], [[ancient greece|greek]] [[sophist]] and [[rhetoric]]ian, flourished in the 4th century bc.  ==life== he was the pupil and successor of [[gorgias]] and taught at [[athens]] at the same time as [[isocrates]], whose rival and opponent he was. we possess two declamations under his name: ''on sophists'' (περὶ σοφιστῶν), directed against isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against isocrates is probably of later date); ''odysseus'' (perhaps spurious)<ref>o'sullivan 2008</ref> in which [[odysseus]] accuses [[palamedes (mythology)|palamedes]] of treachery during the siege of [[troy]].{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  according to alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking ''extempore'' on every conceivable subject. [[aristotle]] (''rhet.'' iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  of other works only fragments and the titles have survived: ''messeniakos'', advocating the freedom of the [[messenia (ancient region)|messenians]] and containing the sentiment that "god has left all men free; nature has made no man a slave";<ref>aristotle, ''[[rhetoric (aristotle)|rhet.]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0060%3abekker+page%3d1373b 1373b] 18–19 with the scholium of the anonymous commentator (''[[commentaria in aristotelem graeca|cag]]'' xxi:2, p. 74.31f.)</ref><ref>j.d. bury and russell meiggs, ''a history of greece to the death of alexander the great'', fourth ed.
