[[tuna]] [[commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. transfers from the [[federal government of the united states|u.s. federal government]] add substantially to american samoa's economic well-being. attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by samoa's remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. [[tourism]], a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in [[east asia]].  ==numbers== '''[[gross domestic product|gdp]]:''' [[purchasing power parity]] - $537 million (2007 est.) <br>''country comparison to the world:'' 210  '''gdp (official exchange rate):''' $462.2 million (2005)  '''gdp - real growth rate:''' 3% (2003) <br>''country comparison to the world:'' 139  '''gdp - per capita:''' purchasing power parity - $7,874 (2008) <br>''country comparison to the world:'' 120  '''gdp - composition by sector:''' <br>''agriculture:'' na% <br>''industry:'' na% <br>''services:'' na% (2002)  '''labor force:''' 17,630 (2005) <br>''country comparison to the world:'' 203  '''labor force - by occupation:''' government 33%, tuna canneries 34%, other 33% (1990)  '''unemployment rate:''' 23.8% (2010) <br>''country comparison to the world:'' 175  '''population below poverty line:''' na% (2002 est.)
