[[file:herma istarchmu747.jpg|thumb|herm of [[hermes]], roman copy of a late 5th century bc original, the forefront inscription states the herm was made by alcamenes and dedicated by pergamios, [[istanbul archaeology museums|istanbul museums]].]]  '''alcamenes''' ({{lang-grc|ἀλκαμένης}}) was an [[ancient greek]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] of [[lemnos]] and [[athens]],  who flourished in the 2nd half of the 5th century bc. he was a younger contemporary of [[phidias]] and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a [[hephaestus]] and an [[aphrodite of the gardens|aphrodite "of the gardens"]] were conspicuous.<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=alcamenes|volume=1|pages=517–518}}</ref>  [[pausanias (geographer)|pausanias]] says<ref>''description of greece'' v. 10. 8</ref> that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of [[zeus]] at [[olympia, greece|olympia]], but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility.<ref name="eb1911"/> pausanias<ref>''description of greece'' i. 8. 4</ref> also refers to a statue of ares by alcamenes that was erected on the [[athenian agora]], which some have related to the [[ares borghese]].  however, the temple of ares to which he refers had only been moved from [[acharnes]] and re-sited in the agora in [[augustus]]'s time, and statues known to derive from alcamenes' statue show the god in a [[breastplate]],<ref>one sculpture of ares and aphrodite is depicted [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&idnotice=20221 in this relief]</ref> so the identification of alcamenes' ares with the ares borghese is not secure.  at [[pergamum]] there was discovered in 1903 a hellenistic copy of the head of the hermes "propylaeus" of alcamenes.<ref>''athenische mittheilungen'', 1904, p.&nbsp;180</ref> as, however, the deity is represented in an [[neo-attic]], archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.<ref name="eb1911"/>  it is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the [[parthenon]], in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of phidias.<ref name="eb1911"/> he is said to be the most eminent sculptor in [[athens]] after the departure of phidias for [[olympia, greece|olympia]], but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies.  ==notes== {{reflist}}  ==references== * {{cite web|title=pausanias, description of greece |date=1918 |website=theoi texts library |publisher=aaron j. atsma |access-date=18 january 2017|translator-last=jones|translator-first=w. h. s.|url=http://www.theoi.com/text/pausanias1a.html}} * julius sillig, ''dictionary of the artists of antiquity''; 1837 * andrew stewart, ''one hundred greek sculptors : their careers and extant works'' * sir charles waldstein, ''alcamenes and the establishment of the classical type in greek art''; 1926  ==external links== {{commons category|alcamenes}} * [http://www.scholarsresource.com/browse/artist/1576 scholars resource: works by alkamenes] * [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/searchresults?target=en&all_words=alcamenes&phrase=&any_words=&exclude_words=&documents= perseus digital library: alcamenes] * [http://archaeosammlungen.uni-graz.at/index.php?id=133&l=2 herma by alcamenes - uni graz]  {{authority control}}  [[category:pergamene sculpture]] [[category:5th-century bc greek sculptors]] [[category:ancient greek sculptors]] [[category:ancient athenian sculptors]] [[category:ancient lemnos]] [[category:metics in classical athens]] [[category:people from lemnos]] [[category:year of birth unknown]] [[category:year of death unknown]]
