[[henry v, duke of brunswick-lüneburg|henry, duke of brunswick-wolfenbüttel]], then took command of the troops of the league, and after albert had been placed under the imperial ban in december 1553 he was defeated by duke henry, and compelled to flee to france.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} he there entered the service of henry ii of france and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at [[pforzheim]] on 8 january 1557.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  he is defined by [[thomas carlyle]] as "a failure of a [[fritz]]," with "features" of a [[frederick ii of prussia|frederick the great]] in him, "but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent". he had early two children: [[friedrich of brandenburg-bayreuth|frederick]] and [[anna of brandenburg-bayreuth|anna]]. he was to be buried heilsbronn münster.  ==ancestors== {{unreferenced section|date=february 2014}} {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} <center>{{ahnentafel-compact4 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; |1= 1.
