"comparative morphology and relationships of the agnostida". in s. koenemann & r. a. jenner (eds.), ''crustacea and arthropod relationships'' (volume , pp. 95-136). taylor and francis group.</ref>  ==ecology== scientists have long debated whether the agnostids lived a [[pelagic]] or a [[benthic]] lifestyle. their lack of eyes, a morphology not well-suited for swimming, and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites all suggest a benthic (bottom-dwelling) mode of life. they are likely to have lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on [[detritus]] that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom. in contrast, their wide geographic dispersion in the [[fossil record]] is uncharacteristic of benthic animals, suggesting a pelagic existence. the thoracic segment appears to form a hinge between the head and pygidium allowing for a bivalved [[ostracod]]an-type lifestyle. furthermore, the orientation of the thoracic appendages appears ill-suited for benthic living. however, recent work suggests that some agnostids were benthic predators, engaging in cannibalism and possibly manifesting pack-hunting behavior.<ref>mcmenamin, m. a. s.
