[[file:coat of arms of alexander jagiellonczyk.svg|thumb|left|200px|coat of arms of alexander i jagiellon]]  during his reign, poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality, [[moldavia]]. only the death of [[stephen iii of moldavia|stephen]], the great ''[[hospodar]]'' of moldavia, enabled poland still to hold her own on the [[danube river]]; while the liberality of [[pope julius ii]], who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of poland and granted alexander [[peter's pence]] and other financial help, enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the teutonic order.  alexander jagellon never felt at home in poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow lithuanians, the most notable of whom was the wealthy lithuanian magnate [[michael glinski]], who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the tatars at [[kleck]] (5 august 1506), news of which was brought to alexander on his deathbed in [[vilnius]].  it is important to note that alexander was the last known ruler of the [[gediminids]] dynasty to have maintained the family's ancestral [[lithuanian language]].{{citation needed|date=april 2010}} from his death, polish became the sole language of the family, thus fully [[polonisation|polonising]] the [[jagiello]] family.  in 1931, during the refurbishment of [[vilnius cathedral]], the forgotten sarcophagus of alexander was discovered, and has since been put on display.  ==gallery== <gallery> file:johann_haller,_commune_incliti_poloniae_regni_privilegium_constitutionum_et_indultuum_publicitus_decretorum_approbatorumque_(1506,_cropped).jpg|king alexander in [[senate of the republic of poland|polish senate]], 1506. file:kanclerz.jpg|alexander and his ''[[kanclerz]]'' [[jan łaski]]. file:vilnius.sv.onos baznycia.saint ann's church2.jpg|[[gothic architecture|gothic]] [[st. anne's church, vilnius|st. anne's church]] in [[vilnius]] was constructed on his initiative in 1495–1500.  file:krakow wawel 20070804 0930.jpg|in 1504 he ordered to rebuild the [[wawel castle|wawel]] in a [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] style.<ref>[http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/index.php?op=4 wawel castle]. history of the royal residence.</ref>  file:alexander of poland.png|portrait by [[bacciarelli]] </gallery>  ==ancestors== {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} <center>{{ahnentafel-compact5 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; |boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe; |1= 1. alexander, king of poland |2= 2.
