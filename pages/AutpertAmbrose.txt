'''autpert ambrose (ambroise)''' ({{lang-la|'''ambrosius autpertus'''}}) (ca. 730 â€“ 784) was a [[franks|frankish]] [[benedictine]] monk.  he became abbot of [[san vincenzo al volturno]] in south italy in the time of [[desiderius]], king of the [[lombards]].  autpert's election as [[abbot]] caused internal dissent at st. vicenzo, and both [[pope stephen iii]] and [[charlemagne]] intervened.  the disagreement was based both on objections to autpert's personality and to his frankish origin.  he wrote a considerable number of works on the bible and religious subjects generally. among these are commentaries on the [[apocalypse]], on the [[psalms]], and on the [[song of solomon]]; ''lives of saints paldo, tuto and vaso''; ''[[assumption of mary|assumption]] of the virgin''; and a ''combat between the virtues and the vices''.<ref>{{cite eb1911|wstitle=ambrose, autpert}}</ref>  in 2009, pope [[benedict xvi]] gave a homily about him in saint peter's square. in this homily, autpert's death date is given as 784 (older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779).<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english on ambrose autpert, "1st mariologist of the west"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427023703/http://www.zenit.org/article-25689?l=english |date=april 27, 2009 }}</ref>  ==references== <references/>  ==external links== {{catholic encyclopedia poster|ambrose autpert}}  {{authority control}} {{defaultsort:ambrose, autpert}} [[category:730s births]] [[category:784 deaths]] [[category:frankish benedictines]] [[category:year of birth uncertain]] [[category:8th-century frankish people]]
