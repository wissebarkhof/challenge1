[[coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. a coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[pacatianus]], explicitly states "year one thousand and first", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''saeculum novum''.  when the roman empire turned christian in the 4th century, the imagery came to be used in a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] sense, and removed legal impediments to the development and public use of the ''[[anno domini]]'' dating system, which came into general use during the reign of [[charlemagne]].  ==relationship with anno domini== the [[anno domini]] (ad) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[dionysius exiguus]] in rome in 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of easter. in his easter table the year 532 was equated with the regnal year 248 of emperor diocletian. the table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[diocletian]] on 20 november 284, or as stated by dionysius: "''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione domini nostri jesu christi annorum tempora praenotare…''" ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our lord jesus christ …").<ref>''liber de paschate'', [[jacques paul migne|migne]], ''[[patrologia latina]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?vid=oclc12663742&id=lceyel-4zuec&pg=pp10&lpg=pp10&dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+lxvii#pra1-pt165,m1 volume 67, page 481, note f]</ref> blackburn and holford-strevens review interpretations of dionysius which place the [[incarnation (christianity)|incarnation]] in 2 bc, 1 bc, or ad 1.<ref>blackburn, b. & holford-strevens, l, ''the oxford companion to the year'' (oxford university press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&ndash;780.</ref> it was later calculated (from the historical record of the succession of [[list of roman consuls|roman consuls]]) that the year ad 1 corresponds to the roman year 754 auc, based on varro's epoch. this however resulted in that year not corresponding with the lifetimes of historical figures reputed to be alive, or otherwise mentioned in connection with the christian incarnation, e.g. [[herod the great]] or [[publius sulpicius quirinius|quirinius]].<ref>suetonius, lives of the caesars: tiberius, 49</ref>  :1 auc (ab urbe condita) = 753 bc :750 auc = 4 bc (death of [[herod the great]]) :754 auc = 1 ad :759 auc = 6 ad ([[quirinius]] becomes governor of syria)  :1000 auc = 247 ad :1500 auc = 747 ad :2000 auc = 1247 ad :2206 auc = 1453 ad ([[fall of constantinople]]) :2245 auc = 1492 ad :2529 auc = 1776 ad :2753 auc = 2000 ad :{{#expr:{{currentyear}}+753}} auc = {{currentyear}} ad  ==see also== {{wiktionary}} * [[list of latin phrases]]  ==notes and references== {{reflist}}  {{ancient rome topics}} {{chronology}}  {{defaultsort:ab urbe condita}} [[category:latin words and phrases]] [[category:roman calendar]] [[category:calendar eras]] [[category:chronology]] [[category:1st-century bc establishments in the roman empire]]
