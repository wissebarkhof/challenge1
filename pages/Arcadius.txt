[[file:arcadius gold multiple cdm paris beistegui 239.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]] of arcadius.]]  ==character and works== in this reign of a weak emperor dominated by court politics, a major theme was the ambivalence felt by prominent individuals and the court parties that formed and regrouped round them towards [[barbarian]]s, which in constantinople at this period meant [[goths]]. in the well-documented episode that revolved around [[gainas]], a number of gothic ''foederati'' stationed in the capital were massacred, the survivors fleeing under the command of gainas to [[thrace]], where they were tracked down by imperial troops and slaughtered and gainas dispatched.  the episode has been traditionally interpreted as a paroxysm of anti-barbarian reaction that served to stabilize the east. the main source for the affair is a mythology ''à clef'' by [[synesius]] of cyrene, ''aegyptus sive de providentia'', (400)<ref>the date 400 is argued for by cameron and long 1993.</ref> an egyptianising allegory that embodies a covert account of the events, the exact interpretation of which continues to baffle scholars. synesius' ''de regno'', which claims to be addressed to arcadius himself, contains a tirade against goths.  a new [[forum of arcadius|forum]] was built in the name of arcadius, on the seventh hill of constantinople, the ''xērolophos'', in which a [[column of arcadius|column]] was begun to commemorate his 'victory' over gainas (although the column was only completed after arcadius' death by [[theodosius ii]]).  the [[pentelic marble]] portrait head of arcadius (now in the [[istanbul archaeology museum]]) was discovered in istanbul close to the forum tauri, in june 1949, in excavating foundations for new buildings of the university at [[beyazıt square|beyazit]].<ref>nezih firatli, "a late antique imperial portrait recently discovered at istanbul" ''american journal of archaeology'' '''55'''.1 (january 1951), pp. 67–71.</ref> the neck was designed to be inserted in a torso, but no statue, base or inscription was found. the [[diadem]] is a fillet with rows of pearls along its edges and a rectangular stone set about with pearls over the young emperor's forehead.  ==see also== {{portal|byzantine empire}} *[[flavia (gens)]] *[[list of byzantine emperors]]  ==notes== {{reflist}}  ==references== *a. cameron and j. long. 1993.
