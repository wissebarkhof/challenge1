(hence, while by modern definitions, he was converting one [[organic compound|organic molecule]] to another, by the parlance of his era, he was converting "inorganic"—''anorganisch''—substances into "organic" ones only thought accessible through vital processes.) he validated his theory by converting [[carbon disulfide]] to [[acetic acid]] in several steps (1843–45). kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural [[radical theory|radicals]], so contributing to the development of [[structural theory]]. a dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary [[alcohol]]s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. kolbe was the first person to use the word [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] in its present-day meaning, and contributed a number of new chemical reactions.<ref name=brit1 />  in particular, kolbe developed procedures for the [[electrolysis]] of the salts of [[fatty acid|fatty]] and other [[carboxylic acid]]s ([[kolbe electrolysis]])<ref>{{cite journal|title = untersuchungen über die elektrolyse organischer verbindungen| author = hermann kolbe| journal = [[annalen der chemie und pharmacie]]| year = 1849| volume = 69| issue = 3| pages = 257–372| doi = 10.1002/jlac.18490690302}}{{primary source inline|date=july 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=lindsey|first=alan|last2=jeskey|first2=harold|date=1957|title=the kolbe schmitt reaction|journal=chem review|volume=}}</ref> and prepared [[salicylic acid]], a building block of [[aspirin]] in a process called [[kolbe synthesis]] or [[kolbe-schmitt reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = ueber synthese der salicylsäure| author = hermann kolbe| journal = [[annalen der chemie und pharmacie]]| year = 1860| volume = 113| issue = 1| pages = 125–127| doi = 10.1002/jlac.18601130120}}</ref><ref name=ksr1>{{cite web|url=http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/kolbe-schmitt-reaction.shtm|title=kolbe-schmitt reaction|accessdate=2016-07-28}}</ref> his method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the [[kolbe nitrile synthesis]],[https://books.google.ca/books?id=4tbwg3diykqc&pg=pa537&lpg=pa537&dq=kolbe+nitrile+synthesis+detailed+explanation&source=bl&ots=x-qzme85h1&sig=agjsca0yjpofedbodsj0voskjhc&hl=en&sa=x&ved=0ahukewje8bzsnprqahvmzomkhe1zbqaq6aeilzad#v=onepage&q=kolbe%20nitrile%] and with [[edward frankland]] he found that [[nitrile]]s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids.<ref name=kns1>{{cite web|url=http://www.organic-chemistry.org/namedreactions/kolbe-nitrile-synthesis.shtm|title=kolbe nitrile synthesis|accessdate=2016-07-28}}</ref> in addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work, kolbe oversaw student research at leipzig and especially at marburg;
