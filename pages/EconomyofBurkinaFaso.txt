relies on [[subsistence agriculture]], with only a small fraction directly involved in [[industry]] and [[tertiary sector of industry|services]]. highly variable rainfall, poor [[soil]]s, lack of adequate communications and other [[infrastructure]], a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this landlocked country. the [[export]] economy also remains subject to fluctuations in world prices.  the country has a high population density, few [[natural resource]]s, and a fragile [[soil]]. industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. following the african franc currency devaluation in january 1994 the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. maintenance of its [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.  the burkinabé financial system represents 30% of the country’s gdp and is dominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90% of total financial system assets. eleven banks and five [[non-bank financial institution]]s operate in the country.  the banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding nearly 60% of total financial sector assets. banks are generally adequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the cotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.  as of 2007, the world bank estimated that 26% of the burkinabé population has access to financial services. the central bank of the west african states (bceao) reports that about 41 microfinance institutions (mfis) operate in the country, serving a total of 800,000 customers. burkina faso is a member of the regional bourse regional des valeurs mobilières (brvm) located in abidjan, ivory coast. as of 2009, the regional stock exchange’s market capitalization reached nearly 10% of burkina faso’s gdp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-financial-sector-profile.html|title=burkina faso

[[gold]] mining has increased greatly since the mid-1980s and, along with cotton, is a leading export moneyearner. however, both gold and cotton are listed as goods produced mostly by child labor and forced labor according to a recent [[u.s. department of labor]] report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|title=list of goods produced by child labor or forced labor|publisher=|accessdate=11 june 2015}}</ref> {{clear}}  ==see also== {{portal|burkina faso|africa}} *[[agriculture in burkina faso]] *[[list of companies based in burkina faso]]  ==references== {{commons category}} {{reflist}} *{{cia world factbook}}  ==external links== *{{dmoz|regional/africa/burkina_faso/business_and_economy}} *[http://www.resimao.org west african agricultural market observer/observatoire du marché agricole  (resimao)], a project of the west-african market information network (wamis-net),  provides live market and commodity prices from fifty seven regional and local public agricultural markets across benin, burkina faso, côte d'ivoire, guinea, niger, mali, senegal, togo, and nigeria.  sixty commodities are tracked weekly. the project is run by the benin ministry of agriculture, and a number of european, african, and united nations agencies. *[http://www.trademap.org/open_access/index.aspx?proceed=true&reporter=854 burkina faso latest trade data on itc trade map]  {{burkina faso topics}} {{africa in topic|economy of}}  {{defaultsort:economy of burkina faso}} [[category:world trade organization member economies|burkina faso]] [[category:economy of burkina faso| ]] [[category:african union member economies|burkina faso]]
