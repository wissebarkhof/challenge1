(the court decided that ''horch'' was a registered trademark on behalf of august horch's former partners and august horch was not entitled to use it any more). consequently, horch named his new company ''[[audi automobilwerke gmbh]]'' in 1910, ''audi'' being the latinization of horch.  ==post audi== horch left audi in 1920 and went to berlin and took various jobs.  he published his autobiography, ''i built cars (ich baute autos)'' in 1937.  he also served on the board of auto union, the successor to audi automobilwerke gmbh.  he was an honorary citizen of zwickau and had a street named for his audi cars in both zwickau and his birthplace winningen.  he was made an honorary professor at [[braunschweig university of technology]].<ref name="autoweek"/> ==after the war== after the war, there were left-wing circles who vilified august horch, claiming he was a nazi, and argued that his honorary citizenship of the city of zwickau should be withdrawn. horch was not a member of the [[nazi party]], nor did he have influence on the production of armaments, so the city council did not comply with the request. in early july 1945, horch moved to [[upper franconia]], where he<ref>die bezeichnung von else kolmar als pflegetochter ist den horch-akten im staatsarchiv chemnitz entnommen.</ref> and his housekeeper and foster daughter else kolmar first found an accommodation in helmbrechts and  three months later in münchberg. the wife of horch wife died on march 26, 1946, at a nursing home in berlin, a few days later his son eberhard. in the summer of 1948, horch and else kolmar, who came from a jewish family, married. <ref>jürgen pönisch: ''august horch – pionier der kraftfahrt''. hrsg. august horch museum zwickau, 2001, {{isbn|3-00-008754-0}}, s. 198,  201–206.</ref>  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{audi}}  {{authority control}}  {{defaultsort:horch, august}} [[category:1868 births]] [[category:1951 deaths]] [[category:audi people]] [[category:automotive pioneers]] [[category:auto union]] [[category:german engineers]] [[category:german company founders]] [[category:horch]] [[category:people from mayen-koblenz]] [[category:people from the rhine province]] [[category:articles lacking sources from june 2009]] [[category:all articles lacking sources]] [[category:german founders of automobile manufacturers]]
