hey, we can probably get a ''lot'' of traffic from about.com.  the way about.com works is this: they have a bunch of people working independently building guides to the internet.  they don't have to make their guides consistent with each other.  they don't know if other guides are or are not accepting links from wikipedia.  in short, in principle, we could get ''huge'' numbers of links from different pages on their website.  they'll love us because we're content-rich, and they like that.  so, if you feel so inspired, please go to [http://search.about.com/fullsearch.htm?terms=encyclopedia&pm=59_0100_s] or for that matter, any page about any subject, and ask for links either to http://www.wikipedia.com/ or to the relevant part of wikipedia.  they've got a ''huge'' (no kidding--''huge'') number of pages on about.com that link to encyclopedias.  wikipedia should be linked from every one of them, but for that we've got to start asking!  :-)  but if you do this, could you please indicate, below, what guide/area you've solicited?  thanks.  * [http://familyinternet.about.com/cs/referencelibrary/ marcy zitz, family internet] * [http://homeworktips.about.com/cs/encyclopedias/index.htm?rnk=r1&terms=encyclopedia cathy spalding, homework tips] * [http://kidspenpals.about.com/cs/dictionaries/ shauna lee de feyter, penpals for kids] * [http://puzzles.about.com/cs/encyclopediaatlas/index.htm?rnk=r2&terms=encyclopedia dave fisher, puzzles] * [http://nanotech.about.com/library/def/bldefindex.htm?rnk=r13&terms=encyclopedia steve lenhert, nanotechnology] * [http://websearch.about.com/cs/encyclopedias/index.htm?rnk=r14&terms=encyclopedia kevin elliott, web search] * [http://netforbeginners.about.com/cs/encyclopedias/index.htm?rnk=r15&terms=encyclopedia gwen schertel, net for beginners] * [http://philosophy.about.com/cs/reference/ rich gray, philosophy] * [http://saltlakecity.about.com/cs/reference/ theresa husarik, salt lake city] * ''write to others!  see http://www.about.com !''
