{{about|the biblical person|other people named amnon|amnon (given name)|the moshav in northern israel|amnun}} according to the [[hebrew bible]], '''amnon''' ({{lang-he-n|אַמְנוֹן}}, "faithful") was the oldest son of [[david (biblical king)|david]] and his wife, [[ahinoam]], who is described as "the [[jezreelite]]ss", born in [[hebron]] when david was king of judah.<ref>{{bibleref2|2 samuel 3:2}}, {{bibleref2|1 chronicles 3:1}}</ref>  [[file:jan steen 001.jpg|thumb|220px|left|amnon and tamar, painted by [[jan steen]]]] ==rape of tamar== although he was the heir-apparent to david's throne, amnon is best remembered for the [[rape]] of his half-sister [[tamar (daughter of david)|tamar]], daughter of david and [[talmai#talmai, father of maacah|maachah]]. despite the biblical [[mitzvah|prohibition]] on sexual relations between half-brothers and sisters,<ref>{{bibleref2|leviticus 18:11}}</ref> amnon had an overwhelming desire for her. he acted on advice from his cousin, [[jonadab]] the son of shimeah, david's brother, to lure tamar into his quarters by pretending to be sick and desiring her to cook a special meal for him. while in his quarters, and ignoring her protests, he [[rape]]d her, then had her expelled from his house. king david was angry about the incident, but could not bring himself to punish his eldest son, while [[absalom]], amnon's half-brother and tamar's full brother, nursed a bitter grudge against amnon for the rape of his sister.  [[file:convito di ansalonne.jpg|thumb|220px|''the banquet of absalom'', attributed to [[niccolò de simone]].]] two years later, to avenge tamar, absalom invited all of david's sons to a feast at sheep-shearing time, then had his servants kill amnon after he had become drunk with wine.<ref>{{bibleref2|2 samuel 13}}</ref> as a result, absalom fled to [[geshur]].  {{bibleref2|2 samuel 13:39}} records that in time david came to terms with the death of amnon, his first-born. [[methodism|methodist]] founder [[john wesley]] is critical of david: "he can almost find in his heart to receive into favour the murderer of his brother. how can we excuse david from the sin of [[eli (biblical figure)|eli]], who honoured his sons more than god?"<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/wes/2_samuel/13.htm wesley's notes on 2 samuel 13], accessed 24 july 2017</ref>  ==literary references== * the spanish poet [[federico garcía lorca]] wrote a poem about amnon's rape of his sister tamar, included in lorca's 1928 poetry collection ''[[romancero gitano]]'' (translated as ''gypsy ballads''). lorca's version is considerably different from the biblical original - amnon is depicted as being overcome by a sudden uncontrollable passion, with none of the cynical planning and premeditation of the original story. he assaults and rapes tamar and then flees into the night on his horse, with archers shooting at him from the walls - whereupon king david cuts the strings of his harp. *''the rape of tamar'', novel by [[dan jacobson]] ({{isbn|1-84232-139-0}}) *[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6ytaaaaqaaj&printsec=frontcover&dq=elizabeth+hands+death+of+amnon&source=bl&ots=c5lhmchnqt&sig=v1ddz6axhjsbfoasyc4xc0kahgq&hl=en&ei=razzte6ricz3gafo7yhldq&sa=x&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0cbqq6aewaa#v=onepage&q&f=false the death of amnon] poem by elizabeth hands  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{commons category|amnon}}  {{authority control}} [[category:books of samuel]] [[category:biblical murder victims]] [[category:david]] [[category:hebrew bible people]] [[category:incest]] [[category:jewish mythology]] [[category:jewish royalty]] [[category:mythological rapists]] {{hebrew-bible-stub}}
