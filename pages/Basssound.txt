''music in theory and practice'', vol. i, p.168. {{isbn|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref>]]  '''bass''' describes [[pitch (music)|tone]]s of low (also called "deep") [[frequency]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[range (music)|range]] from 16-256 hz (c0 to [[middle c]]4). in musical compositions, such as [[song]]s and pieces, these are the lowest parts of the [[harmony]]. in [[choral music]] without instrumental accompaniment, the bass is supplied by adult male [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singers. in an [[orchestra]], the [[bass line]]s are played by the [[double bass]] and [[cello]]s, [[bassoon]] or [[contrabassoon]], low [[brass instrument|brass]] such as the [[tuba]] and [[bass trombone]], and the [[timpani]] (kettledrums). in many styles of [[traditional music]] such as [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]], and in styles such as [[rockabilly]] and [[big band]] and [[bebop]] [[jazz]], the bass role is filled by the [[upright bass]]. in most [[rock music|rock]] and [[popular music|pop]] bands and in [[jazz fusion]] groups, the bass role is filled by the [[electric bass]]. in some 20th and 21st century pop genres, such as 1980s pop, [[hip hop music]] and [[electronic dance music]], the bass role may be filled with a [[bass synthesizer]].  ==musical role== when bass notes are played in a [[musical ensemble]] such an [[orchestra]], they are frequently used to provide a [[counterpoint]] or counter-[[melody]], in a [[harmony|harmonic]] context either to outline or juxtapose the progression of the [[chord (music)|chord]]s, or with [[percussion instrument|percussion]] to underline the [[rhythm]]. in popular music, the bass part, which is called the "[[bassline]]", typically provides harmonic and rhythmic support to the band. the bass player is a member of the [[rhythm section]] in a band, along with the [[drum kit|drummer]], [[rhythm guitar]]ist, and, in some cases, a [[keyboard instrument]] player (e.g., [[piano]] or [[hammond organ]]). the bass player usually plays the root or fifth of the chord (and to a lesser degree, the third of the chord) and accents the strong beats. "the bass differs from other voices because of the particular role it plays in supporting and defining harmonic motion. it does so at levels ranging from immediate, chord-by-chord events to the larger harmonic organization of a entire work."<ref>cadwallader, allen (1998). ''analysis of tonal music: a schenkerian approach'', p. 45. {{isbn|0195102320}}.</ref>  ==kinds of bass harmony== in [[classical music]], different forms of bass are: ''basso concertante'', or ''basso recitante''; the bass voice of the chorus; the bass which accompanies the softer passages of a composition, as well as those passages which employ the whole power of the ensemble, generally played by the [[violoncello]]s in orchestral music; ''contrabass'' (“under bass”), is described as that part which is performed by the [[double bass]]es; violoncellos often play the same line an octave higher, or a different melodic or rhythmic part which is not a bassline when double basses are used; ''basso ripieno''; that bass which joins in the full passages of a composition, and, by its depth of tone and energy of stroke, affords a powerul contrast to the lighter and softer passages or movements.<ref name=ea>{{cite americana|wstitle=bass (music)}}</ref> [[basso continuo]] was an approach to writing music during the [[baroque music]] era (1600-1750).  ==bass instruments== {{main|bass (instrument)}}  ===keyboards=== *[[keyboard bass]] *[[pedal keyboard]] ===percussion=== *[[bass drum]] *[[timpani]] ===string bass=== *[[double bass]] *[[bass guitar]] *[[washtub bass]]  ===bass wind instruments===  ====woodwind==== *[[bassoon]] *[[bass clarinet]] *[[bass saxophone]] *[[contrabassoon]] ====brass==== *[[tuba]] *[[bass trombone]] *[[euphonium]]  ==see also== *[[sub bass]] *[[treble (sound)]] *[[bass clef]] *[[figured bass]]  ==sources== {{reflist}}  {{bass (sound)}} {{range (music)}}  {{defaultsort:bass (sound)}} [[category:articles lacking sources from june 2009]] [[category:all articles lacking sources]] [[category:bass (sound)| ]]
