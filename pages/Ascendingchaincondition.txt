in mathematics, the '''ascending chain condition (acc)''' and '''descending chain condition (dcc)''' are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in certain [[commutative ring]]s.<ref>hazewinkel, gubareni & kirichenko (2004), p.6, prop. 1.1.4.</ref><ref>fraleigh & katz (1967), p. 366, lemma 7.1</ref><ref>jacobson (2009), p. 142 and 147</ref> these conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of [[david hilbert]], [[emmy noether]], and [[emil artin]]. the conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any [[partially ordered set]]. this point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to gabriel and rentschler.  == definition == a [[partially ordered set]] (poset) ''p'' is said to satisfy the '''ascending chain condition''' (acc) if every strictly ascending sequence of elements [[eventually (mathematics)|eventually]] terminates.  equivalently, given any sequence :<math>a_1 \,\leq\, a_2 \,\leq\, a_3 \,\leq\, \cdots,</math> there exists a positive [[integer]] ''n'' such that :<math>a_n = a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} = \cdots.</math> similarly, ''p'' is said to satisfy the '''descending chain condition''' (dcc) if every strictly descending sequence of elements eventually terminates, that is, there is no [[infinite descending chain]]. equivalently every descending sequence :<math>\cdots \,\leq\, a_3 \,\leq\, a_2 \,\leq\, a_1</math> of elements of ''p'', eventually stabilizes.  === comments === * the descending chain condition on ''p'' is equivalent to ''p'' being [[well-founded]]: every nonempty subset of ''p'' has a minimal element (also called the '''minimal condition'''). * similarly, the ascending chain condition is equivalent to ''p'' being converse well-founded: every nonempty subset of ''p'' has a maximal element (the '''maximal condition'''). * trivially every finite poset satisfies both acc and dcc. * a [[total order|totally ordered set]] that satisfies the descending chain condition is called a [[well-order|well-ordered set]].  == see also == * [[artinian (disambiguation)|artinian]] * [[noetherian]] * [[krull dimension]] * [[ascending chain condition for principal ideals]] * [[maximal condition on congruences]]  == notes == <references/>  == references == * [[m. f. atiyah|atiyah, m. f.]], and i. g. macdonald, ''[[introduction to commutative algebra]]'', perseus books, 1969, {{isbn|0-201-00361-9}} * [[michiel hazewinkel]], nadiya gubareni, v. v. kirichenko.
