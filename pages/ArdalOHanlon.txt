(irish tv series)|who do you think you are?]]'' which aired on 6 october 2008 revealed that o'hanlon's paternal grandfather, michael o'hanlon, was a [[university college dublin|ucd]] medicine student who had joined the [[irish republican army (1917–22)|ira]] during the [[irish war of independence]] and was a member of [[michael collins (irish leader)|michael collins]]' squad which assassinated british secret service agents on the morning of [[bloody sunday (1920)|bloody sunday]]. details of his grandfather's activities survive in ucd archives, as well as [[blackrock college]]. it also transpired that, on his mother's side, he is a close relative of [[peter fenelon collier]].  o'hanlon was schooled in [[blackrock college]] in dublin and graduated, in 1987, from the [[national institute for higher education]], [[dublin]] (now [[dublin city university]]) with a degree in communications studies.  ==career== together with kevin gildea and barry murphy, o'hanlon founded the international comedy cellar, upstairs in the international bar on dublin's south wicklow street. dublin had no comedy scene at the time. as a stand up, o'hanlon won the [[hackney empire new act of the year]] competition in 1994. for a time he was the presenter of ''the stand up show''.  he was spotted by [[graham linehan]], who was to cast him as father dougal mcguire in ''[[father ted]]'' (1995–98). in 1995 he received the top tv comedy newcomer at the british comedy awards for this role. in 1995, he appeared (as father dougal) in a [[channel 4]] [[television ident|ident]] ("hello, you're watching.... television"), and during [[comic relief (charity)|comic relief]] on bbc1. this was followed by the award-winning short comedy film ''[[flying saucer rock'n'roll]]''.  o'hanlon moved into straight acting alongside [[emma fielding]] and [[beth goddard]] in the [[itv (tv network)|itv]] comedy-drama ''big bad world'', which aired for two series in summer 1999 and winter 2001. he also played a minor role in ''[[the butcher boy (1997 film)|the butcher boy]]'' as joe's (francie's best friend) father, and appeared in an episode of the original ''[[whose line is it anyway?
