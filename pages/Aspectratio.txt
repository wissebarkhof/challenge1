[[file:elps-slr.svg|center|500px]]  ==aspect ratios of general shapes==  in [[geometry]], there are several alternative definitions to aspect ratios of general [[compact set]]s in a d-dimensional space:<ref name=smithwormald1998>{{cite book  | last1 = smith | first1 = w. d.  | last2 = wormald | first2 = n. c.  | doi = 10.1109/sfcs.1998.743449  | chapter = geometric separator theorems and applications  | title = proceedings 39th annual symposium on foundations of computer science (cat. no.98cb36280)  | pages = 232  | year = 1998  | isbn = 0-8186-9172-7  | pmid =   | pmc =  | url = http://users.monash.edu.au/~nwormald/papers/geomsep.ps.gz }}</ref>  * the diameter-width aspect ratio (dwar) of a compact set is the ratio of its diameter to its width. a circle has the minimal dwar which is 1. a square has a dwar of sqrt(2).  * the cube-volume aspect ratio (cvar) of a compact set is the d-th root of the ratio of the d-volume of the smallest enclosing axes-parallel d-cube, to the set's own d-volume. a square has the minimal cvar which is 1. a circle has a cvar of sqrt(2). an axis-parallel rectangle of width w and height h, where w>h, has a cvar of sqrt(w^2/wh) = sqrt(w/h).  if the dimension d is fixed, then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors.  ==notations== aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as ''x'':''y'' (pronounced "x-to-y").  cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height. in [[digital image]]s there is a subtle distinction between the ''display'' aspect ratio (the image as displayed) and the [[storage aspect ratio|''storage'' aspect ratio]] (the ratio of pixel dimensions); see [[aspect ratio (image)#distinctions|distinctions]].  ==see also== * [[ratio]] * [[equidimensional]] ratios in 3d * [[list of film formats]] * [[squeeze mapping]] * [[vertical orientation]]  == references== <references />  {{fractions and ratios}}  {{defaultsort:aspect ratio}} [[category:ratios]]
