{{use dmy dates|date=june 2013}} in [[law]], an '''abstract''' is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long [[legal document]] or of several related legal papers.  ==abstract of title== {{main|abstract of title}} {{unreferenced section|type=law|date=november 2007}} the abstract of title, used in [[real estate]] transactions, is the more common form of abstract. an abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land, a house, or a building before it came into possession of the present owner. the abstract also records all [[deed]]s, [[will (law)|wills]], [[mortgage law|mortgages]], and other documents that affect [[ownership]] of the property. an abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners.  ==clear title== {{unreferenced section|type=law|date=november 2007}} a clear title to property is one that clearly states any obligation in the deed to the property. it reveals no breaks{{clarify|reason= does this mean "it shews an unbroken chain"?|date=february 2011}}in the chain of legal ownership. after the records of the property have been traced and the title has been found clear, it is sometimes guaranteed, or insured. in a few states, a different system of insuring title of real properties provides for registration of a clear title with public authorities. after this is accomplished, no abstract of title is necessary.  ==patent law== in the context of [[patent]] law and specifically in [[prior art]] searches, searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] or [[inventive step and non-obviousness|inventive step]] (or [[inventive step and non-obviousness|non-obviousness]] in united states patent law) of an invention. under [[united states patent law]], the abstract may be called "abstract of the disclosure".<ref>[[united states patent and trademark office]] (uspto) web site, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/0600_608_01_b.htm 608.01(b) abstract of the disclosure]</ref>  ==administrative process== certain government bureaucracies, such as a ''department of motor vehicles'' will issue an '''abstract''' of a completed transaction or an updated record intended to serve as a proof of compliance with some administrative requirement. this is often done in advance of the update of reporting databases and/or the issuance of official documents.  ==notes== {{reflist}}  ==see also== *[[property abstract]]  ==references== * [[world book]] encyclopedia 1988  == external links == * {{pct rule|8}}, defining the requirements regarding the abstract in an international application filed under [[patent cooperation treaty]] (pct) * {{epc article|85}} and {{epc rule|47}} (previously {{epc 1973 rule|33}}), defining the abstract-related requirements in a [[european patent convention|european patent application]]  {{defaultsort:abstract (law)}} [[category:legal research]]
