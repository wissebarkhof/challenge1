none of charlemagne's daughters were married, despite political offers of arranged marriages.  in 790, he retired to the abbey of centulum, the "monastery of st richarius" ({{lang|la|''sancti richarii monasterium''}}) at present-day [[saint-riquier]] in [[picardy]].{{sfnp|eb|1878}} elected [[abbot]] in 794,{{sfnp|eb|1878}} he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of 200 volumes.{{sfnp|ce|1907}} it was not uncommon for the [[merovingian]], [[carolingian]], or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries; the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation. angilbert, in contrast, spent a great deal rebuilding saint-riquier; when he completed it, charlemagne spent easter of the year 800 there. in keeping with carolingian policies, angilbert established a school at saint-riquier to educate the local boys.{{sfnp|ebe|2003}}  his latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family.{{sfnp|eb|1911}} charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames. charlemagne was referred to as "david", a reference to the biblical king [[david]].{{sfnp|wilmot-buxton|1922|p=93}} angilbert was nicknamed "[[homer]]" because he wrote poetry,{{sfnp|citd|1998}} and was the probable author of an [[epic poetry|epic]], of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between charlemagne and leo iii. it is a mosaic from [[virgil]], [[ovid]], [[lucan]] and [[venantius fortunatus]], composed in the manner of einhard's use of suetonius.{{sfnp|eb|1911}} of the shorter poems, besides the greeting to pippin on his return from the campaign against the [[pannonian avars|avars]] (796), an epistle to david (i.e., charlemagne) incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. the reference to bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation.{{sfnp|eb|1911}}  ==works== angilbert's poems were published by [[ernst dümmler]] in the ''[[monumenta germaniae historica]]''. for criticisms of this edition, see [[ludwig traube (palaeographer)|ludwig traube]] in max roediger's ''schriften für germanische philologie'' (1888).{{sfnp|eb|1911}}  ==notes== {{reflist|20em}}  ==references== * {{citation|contribution=st. angilbert |contribution-url=http://www.christdesert.org/cgi-bin/martyrology.dynamic.5.cgi?name=angilbert |title=martyrology |url=http://www.christdesert.org/public_texts/martyrology/ |publisher=monastery of christ in the desert |date=1998 |location=abiquiú, new mexico |ref={{harvid|citd|1998}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611021417/http://christdesert.org/public_texts/martyrology/ |archivedate=11 june 2015 }}. * {{cite eb9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=st angilbert |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|eb|1878}} |page=29 }} * {{citation |last=frassetto |first=michael |contribution=st. angilbert (c.&nbsp;740–814) |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yw-gfelbafqc&pg=pa32 |title=encyclopedia of barbarian europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yw-gfelbafqc |location=santa barbara, california |publisher=abc-clio |date=2003 |isbn=978-1576072639 |ref={{harvid|ebe|2003}} |page=32 }} * {{cite ce1913 |mode=cs2 |last=thurston |first=herbert |wstitle=st. angilbert |ref={{harvid|ce|1907}} }}. * {{citation |last=wilmot-buxton |first=e.m. |title=alcuin |date=1922 |publisher=p.j. kennedy & sons |location=new york |url=https://archive.org/stream/alcuin__00wilm }}  '''attribution:''' * {{eb1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=angilbert |volume=2 |ref={{harvid|eb|1911}} |page=9 }}  ==further reading== * [[a. molinier]], ''les sources de l'histoire de france''.  {{authority control}} {{use dmy dates|date=june 2013}}  [[category:8th-century births]] [[category:814 deaths]] [[category:medieval latin poets]] [[category:9th-century christian saints]] [[category:carolingian saints]] [[category:carolingian latin writers]] [[category:8th-century frankish people]]
