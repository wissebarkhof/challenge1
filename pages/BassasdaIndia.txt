[[jaguar seamount]] and [[hall tablemount]] lie, respectively, about 40 and 70&nbsp;km further southwest.  ==gallery== <gallery> file:bassas da india atoll map-fr.png|detailed map. file:bassas_da_india.jpg|[[international space station|iss]] photograph. file:bassas da india.png|[[landsat program|landsat 7]] image. file:bassas da india-cia wfb map.png|[[the world factbook|cia wfb]] map. file:bassas da india 76.jpg|[[central intelligence agency|cia]] map. file:bassas da india in sunglint.jpg|iss image of bassas da india with varying degrees of sunglint. </gallery>  == history ==  the bassas da india was first recorded by [[portuguese explorers]] in the early sixteenth century as the "'''''baixo da'' judia'''" ("''jewess'' shoals"). the ''judia'' ("''jewess''", for the ancestry of its owner [[fernão de loronha]]<ref>bernardo gomes de brito.
