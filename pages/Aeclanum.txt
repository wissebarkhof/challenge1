[[avellino]]) may also follow an ancient line. today there are ruins of the city walls, of an [[aqueduct (roman)|aqueduct]], baths and an [[amphitheatre]]; nearly 400 inscriptions have also been discovered. excavation has revealed a long history of pre-roman settlement.<ref name=princeton>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus:text:1999.04.0006:id=aeclanum "aeclanum (eclano) italy" in ''the princeton encyclopedia of classical sites'']</ref><ref name=eb1911>{{eb1911|inline=1|wstitle=aeclanum|volume=1|page=244}}</ref><ref>[http://spazioinwind.libero.it/popoli_antichi/altro/aeclanum.html aeclanum]</ref>  == history == aeclanum became the chief town of the [[hirpini]], after [[benevento|beneventum]] had become a [[rome|roman]] [[colony]].
