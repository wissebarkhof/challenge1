"the theory of probabilities and telephone conversations" - which proves that the [[poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic. * in 1917 - "solution of some problems in the theory of probabilities of significance in automatic telephone exchanges" - which contains his classic formulae for [[grade of service#erlang's lost call assumptions|call loss]] and waiting time.  these and other notable papers were translated into english, french and german.  his papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field.  one researcher from [[bell telephone laboratories]] is said to have learned danish to study them.  the [[bt group plc|british post office]] accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities.  in 1946, the [[ccitt]] named the international unit of telephone traffic "the [[erlang (unit)|erlang]]".<ref>{{mactutor biography|id=erlang}}</ref> a statistical distribution and programming language listed below have also been named in his honour.  == see also ==  * [[erlang unit|erlang]] – a unit of communication activity * [[erlang distribution]] – a statistical [[probability]] distribution * [[erlang (programming language)|erlang programming language]] – developed by [[ericsson]] for large industrial real-time systems * [[queueing theory]] * [[teletraffic engineering]]  == references ==  ;notes {{reflist}}  {{no footnotes|date=november 2009}}  ;bibliography  * angus, ian.
