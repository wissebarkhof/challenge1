(unusual combinations of [[xyy syndrome|xyy]], [[klinefelter syndrome|xxy]], [[triple x syndrome|xxx]], [[xxxx syndrome|xxxx]], [[xxxxx syndrome|xxxxx]] or [[xxyy syndrome|xxyy]], among [[aneuploidy|other allosome combinations]], are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.)  autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes. for example, the [[sry]] gene on the y chromosome encodes the transcription factor [[testis determining factor|tdf]] and is vital for male sex determination during development. tdf functions by activating the [[sox9]] gene on [[chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]], so mutations of the [[sox9]] gene can cause humans with a y chromosome to develop as females.<ref>foster, jamie w., et al.
