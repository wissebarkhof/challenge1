the school was intended to serve the danish mission, but accomplished little.  after [[louis the pious|louis]] died in 840, his empire was divided and ansgar lost the abbey of [[torhout|turholt]], which had been given as an endowment for his work. then in 845, the [[danes]] unexpectedly raided hamburg, destroying all the church's treasures and books and leaving the entire diocese unrestorable.  ansgar now had neither see nor revenue. many of his helpers deserted him, but the new king, [[louis the german]], came to his aid; after failing to recover turholt for him, in 847 he awarded him the vacant diocese of bremen, where he took up residence in 848. however, since hamburg had been an archbishopric, the sees of bremen and hamburg were combined for him. this presented canonical difficulties and also aroused the anger of the bishop of cologne, to whom bremen had been [[suffragan]], but after prolonged negotiations, [[pope nicholas i]] approved the union of the two dioceses in 864.  through all this political turmoil, ansgar continued his mission to the northern lands. the danish civil war compelled him to establish good relations with two kings, [[horik i|horik the elder]] and his son, [[horik ii]]. both assisted him until his death (wood, 124–125). he was able to secure recognition of christianity as a tolerated religion and permission to build a church in [[sleswick]]. he did not forget the swedish mission, and spent two years there in person (848–850), at the critical moment when a pagan reaction was threatened, which he succeeded in averting. in 854, ansgar returned to sweden when king [[olof (i) of sweden|olof]] ruled in birka. according to rimbert, he was well disposed to christianity. on a viking raid to [[apuole]] (current village in [[lithuania]]) in [[courland]], the swedes plundered the [[curonians]].  ansgar wore a rough hair shirt, lived on bread and water, and showed great charity to the poor. being the first missionary in sweden and the organiser of the hierarchy in the [[nordic countries]], he was declared patron of [[scandinavia]].<ref name=shmi /> ansgar was buried in [[bremen (city)|bremen]] in 865.  his life story was written by his successor as archbishop, [[rimbert]], in the ''[[vita ansgari]]i''.  == relics == relics are located in [[hamburg]] on two places: st. mary's cathedral (germ.: domkirche st. marien) and st. ansgar's and st. bernard's church (germ.: st. ansgar und st. bernhard kirche).  ==visions== [[file:erzbischof ansgar 01 kmj.jpg|thumb|upright|saint ansgar statue in hamburg]] although a historical document and primary source written by a man whose existence can be proven historically, the ''[[vita ansgari]]i'' ("the life of ansgar") aims above all to demonstrate ansgar's sanctity. it is partly concerned with ansgar's visions, which, according to the author rimbert, encouraged and assisted ansgar's remarkable missionary feats.  through the course of this work, ansgar repeatedly embarks on a new stage in his career following a vision.  according to rimbert, his early studies and ensuing devotion to the ascetic life of a monk were inspired by a vision of his mother in the presence of saint mary.  again, when the swedish people were left without a priest for some time, he begged king horik to help him with this problem; then after receiving his consent, consulted with bishop gautbert to find a suitable man. the two together sought the approval of king louis, which he granted when he learned that they were in agreement on the issue. ansgar was convinced he was commanded by heaven to undertake this mission, and was influenced by a vision he received when he was concerned about the journey, in which he met a man who reassured him of his purpose and informed him of a prophet that he would meet, the [[abbot]] [[adalard of corbie|adalhard]], who would instruct him in what was to happen.  in the vision, he searched for and found adalhard, who commanded, "islands, listen to me, pay attention, remotest peoples", which ansgar interpreted as god's will that he go to the scandinavian countries as "most of that country consisted of islands, and also, when 'i will make you the light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth' was added, since the end of the world in the north was in swedish territory".<ref name=rimbert>{{cite web|first=rimbert|title=life of anskar, the apostle of the north, 801–865|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/anskar.asp|work=medieval sourcebook|publisher=new york: fordham university|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>  statues dedicated to him stand in [[hamburg]], [[copenhagen]], [[ribe]] as well as a stone cross at [[birka]]. a [[impact crater|crater]] on the [[moon]], [[ansgarius (crater)|ansgarius]], has been named for him. his [[calendar of saints|feast day]] is 3 february.  ==see also==  {{portal|saints}} *[[list of catholic saints]] *[[list of eastern orthodox saints]] * [[hochkirchlicher apostolat st. ansgar]] *''[[vita ansgari]]i''  ==references== {{reflist}} * jakobsson, sverrir.
