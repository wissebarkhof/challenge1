''animals.nationalgeographic.com''. national geographic society.</ref> and the small ''[[chinese alligator|a. sinensis]]'' in the [[yangtze river]], [[china]], which grows to an average of 5&nbsp;ft (1.5&nbsp;m). their name derives from the [[spanish language|spanish]] ''el lagarto'', which means "the lizard".  == caimans == in [[central america|central]] and [[south america]], the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily [[caimaninae]], which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony [[scute]]s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. besides the three species in ''[[caiman (genus)|caiman]]'', the smooth-fronted caimans in genus ''[[paleosuchus]]'' and the black caiman in ''[[melanosuchus]]'' are described. caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators.<ref name="guggisberg">{{cite book | author = guggisberg, c.a.w. |url =  | title = crocodiles: their natural history, folklore, and conservation| year = 1972 | page = 195 | isbn = 0-7153-5272-5}}</ref>  ''c. crocodilus'', the [[caiman crocodilus|spectacled caiman]], has the widest distribution, from southern mexico to the northern half of argentina, and grows to a modest size of about {{convert|2.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. the largest is the [[red list|near-threatened]] ''melanosuchus niger'', the ''jacare-assu'' or large or [[black caiman]] of the [[amazon river]] basin. black caimans grow to {{convert|16.5|ft|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, with the largest recorded size {{convert|5.79|m|abbr=on}}. the black caiman and [[american alligator]] are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family.  although caimans have not been studied in depth, scientists have learned their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring.  == differences from crocodiles ==  [[alligator]]s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the [[crocodile]]; in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips; and an intolerance to salinity, alligators strongly preferring fresh water, while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt. in general, crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators. another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and american alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/alligators_eat_fruit.php |author=naish, darren |date=3 october 2008 |title=tetrapod zoology: alligators eat fruit |website=scienceblogs.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210205941/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/alligators_eat_fruit.php |archivedate=10 december 2008 }}</ref>  == taxonomy == [[image:crocnest.jpg|thumb|right|an alligator nest at [[everglades national park]], [[florida]], united states]] [[image:alligator prenasalis.jpg|thumb|right|''alligator prenasalis'' fossil]] [[file:alligator olseni.jpg|thumb|''a. olseni'' fore limb]] * '''superfamily [[alligatoroidea]]''' ** '''family alligatoridae''' *** '''subfamily [[alligatorinae]]''' **** genus ''[[albertochampsa]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[chrysochampsa]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[hassiacosuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[navajosuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[ceratosuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[allognathosuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[hispanochampsa]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[arambourgia]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[procaimanoidea]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[wannaganosuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[krabisuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[eoalligator]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[alligator]]'' ***** ''[[alligator prenasalis]]'' (extinct) ***** ''[[alligator mcgrewi]]'' (extinct) ***** ''[[alligator olseni]]'' (extinct) ***** [[chinese alligator]], ''alligator sinensis '' ***** ''[[alligator mefferdi]]'' (extinct) ***** [[american alligator]], ''alligator mississippiensis *** '''subfamily [[caimaninae]]''' **** genus ''[[necrosuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[eocaiman]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[paleosuchus]]'' ***** [[cuvier's dwarf caiman]], ''paleosuchus palpebrosus'' ***** [[smooth-fronted caiman]], ''paleosuchus trigonatus'' **** genus ''[[purussaurus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[mourasuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[orthogenysuchus]]'' (extinct) **** genus ''[[caiman (genus)|caiman]]'' ***** [[yacare caiman]], ''caiman yacare'' ***** [[spectacled caiman]], ''caiman crocodilus '' ****** rio apaporis caiman, ''c. c. apaporiensis '' ****** brown caiman, ''c. c. fuscus'' ***** ''[[caiman lutescans]]'' (extinct) ***** [[broad-snouted caiman]], ''caiman latirostris '' **** genus ''[[melanosuchus]]'' ***** ''[[melanosuchus fisheri]]'' (extinct) ***** [[black caiman]], ''melanosuchus niger''  == references == {{reflist}}  == external links == *[http://www.crocodilian.com "crocodilians: natural history & conservation"] ''crocodilian.com'' *[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?taxon_no=38421&is_real_user=1&action=taxoninfo# "family alligatoridae gray 1844 (alligator)"], ''fossilworks.org''. *{{commons category-inline}} *{{wikispecies-inline}}  {{crocodilia|a.}} {{crocs}}  [[category:alligatoridae| ]] [[category:taxa named by john edward gray]] [[category:reptile families]] [[category:extant campanian first appearances]] [[category:campanian taxonomic families]] [[category:maastrichtian taxonomic families]] [[category:danian taxonomic families]] [[category:selandian taxonomic families]] [[category:thanetian taxonomic families]] [[category:ypresian taxonomic families]] [[category:lutetian taxonomic families]] [[category:bartonian taxonomic families]] [[category:priabonian taxonomic families]] [[category:rupelian taxonomic families]] [[category:chattian taxonomic families]] [[category:aquitanian taxonomic families]] [[category:burdigalian taxonomic families]] [[category:langhian taxonomic families]] [[category:serravallian taxonomic families]] [[category:tortonian taxonomic families]] [[category:messinian taxonomic families]] [[category:zanclean taxonomic families]] [[category:piacenzian taxonomic families]] [[category:gelasian taxonomic families]] [[category:calabrian taxonomic families]] [[category:ionian taxonomic families]] [[category:tarantian taxonomic families]] [[category:holocene taxonomic families]]
