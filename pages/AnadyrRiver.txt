[[reindeer]], upon which the local inhabitants subsisted, were once found in considerable numbers,<ref>this point was made in 1911: "reindeer, upon which the inhabitants subsist, are found in considerable numbers" {{harv|chisholm|1911}}.</ref> but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in 1992. as herds of domestic reindeer have declined, herds of wild [[caribou]] have increased.  there are ten species of [[salmon]] inhabiting the anadyr river basin.  every year, on the last sunday in april, there is an ice fishing competition in the frozen estuarine waters of the anadyr river's mouth. this festival is locally known as '''korfest'''.  the area is a summering place for a number of migratory birds including [[brent goose|brent geese]], [[eurasian wigeon]]s, and the [[northern pintail|pintails]] of [[california]].{{sfn|henny|1973|pp=23-29}}<ref>[http://www.werc.usgs.gov/pinsat/journal2001.html "biologist's journal 2001"  western ecological research center, united states geological survey]</ref>  ==see also== * [[operation anadyr]]  ==notes== {{refimprove|date=october 2012}} {{reflist}}  ==references== *{{cite eb1911|ref=harv|wstitle=anadyr|volume=1|page=907}} *{{cite journal|ref=harv |last=henny |first=charles j. |date=january 1973 |title=drought displaced movement of north american pintails into siberia |journal=the journal of wildlife management |volume=37 |number=1 |pages=23–29 |doi=10.2307/3799734}}  ==external links== * [http://www.chukotka.org/en/tourism/about_tourism/kind_of_tourism/ "tourist and environmental information"] chukotka autonomous okrug website, in english * [https://web.archive.org/web/20071018001037/http://wildsalmoncenter.org/pops/anadyrriver.php "russia far east: anadyr river" wild salmon center] ** [https://web.archive.org/web/20080510105121/http://www.wildsalmoncenter.org/rapidassessments/anadyrrapidassessment.pdf anadyr river watershed] * [https://web.archive.org/web/20090305111407/http://www.faculty.uaf.edu/ffpag/snezhnoe.html "snezhnoye: a village on the anadyr' river"]  {{coord|67|00|n|173|00|e|region:ru_source:jawiki|display=title}}  [[category:rivers of chukotka autonomous okrug]] [[category:bodies of water of the bering sea]]
