covers most of europe and extends into asia. over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the [[northern hemisphere]] typically migrate south (some well into the southern hemisphere) for the northern winter.  ==systematics== the first [[species description|formal description]] of the common buzzard was by the swedish naturalist [[carl linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of systema naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[systema naturae]]'' under the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''falco buteo''.<ref name=linnaeus1758/> the genus ''buteo'' was introduced by the french naturalist [[bernard germain de lacépède]] in 1799 by [[tautonymy]] with the specific name of this species.<ref>{{ cite book | last=lacépède | first=bernard germain de |

group is mainly resident or short-distance [[bird migration|migrants]]. they are: * ''buteo buteo buteo'': most of europe * ''b. b. rothschildi'': [[azores]] * ''b. b. insularum'': [[canary islands]]<!-- birdconservint14:203 --> * ''b. b. pojana'': [[corsica]] and [[sardinia]] * ''b. b. menetriesi'': [[caucasus]] * ''b. b. harterti'': [[madeira]], doubtfully distinct from nominate ''buteo''  the eastern ''vulpinus'' group includes * ''b. b. vulpinus'' ('''steppe buzzard'''): [[eurasia]]: migrant breeder  ==description== [[file:common buzzard at sasan gir.jpg|thumb|front view]] the common buzzard measures between {{convert|40|and|58|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length with a {{convert|109|-|136|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan and a body mass of {{convert|427|-|1364|g|lb|abbr=on}}, making it a medium-sized [[bird of prey|raptor]].<ref name=crc/><ref name=raptorsworld/>  this broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in europe can be confused with the similar [[rough-legged buzzard]] (''buteo lagopus'') and the distantly related [[european honey buzzard]] (''pernis apivorus''), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from [[northern goshawk]]s.{{citation needed|date=september 2011}} the plumage can vary in britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.  ==behaviour==  the common buzzard breeds in [[woodland]]s, usually on the fringes, but favours hunting over open land. it eats mainly small [[mammal]]s, and will come to [[carrion]]. a great opportunist, it adapts well to a varied diet of pheasant, rabbit, other small mammals to medium mammals, snakes and lizards, and can often be seen walking over recently ploughed fields looking for worms and insects.{{citation needed|date=may 2011}}  buzzards do not normally form [[flocks]], but several may be seen together on [[bird migration|migration]] or in good habitat. the [[victorian era|victorian]] writer on [[dartmoor]], [[william crossing]], noted he had on occasions seen flocks of 15 or more at some places.{{citation needed|date=march 2016}} though a rare occurrence, as many as 20 buzzards can be spotted in one field area, approximately {{convert|30|m|ft}} apart, so cannot be classed as a flock in the general sense, consisting of birds without a mate or territory. they are fiercely territorial, and, though rare, fights do break out if one strays onto another pair's territory, but dominant displays of aggression will normally see off the interloper. pairs mate for life. to attract a mate (or impress his existing mate) the male performs a ritual aerial display before the beginning of spring. this spectacular display is known as 'the roller coaster'. he will rise high up in the sky, to turn and plummet downward, in a spiral, twisting and turning as he comes down. he then rises immediately upward to repeat the exercise.  the call is a plaintive ''peea-ay'', similar to a cat's [[cat communication#meow|meow]].  ==status== in parts of its range it is increasing in numbers. in [[ireland]] it became extinct about 1910, but began to slowly recolonise the country in the 1950s, and is now a common and familiar sight over much of ireland.  ==steppe buzzard== the steppe buzzard, ''b. (b.) vulpinus'' breeds from east europe eastward to the far east (including eastern china and south asia), excluding japan. it is a long-distance [[bird migration|migrant]], excepting some north [[himalayas|himalayan]] birds, and winters in africa, india and southeastern asia. in the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.  the steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, ''b. vulpinus''. compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller ({{convert|45|–|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long), longer winged and longer tailed. the two colour morphs are the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (''vulpes'' is latin for "fox") and a dark grey form.  the tail of ''b. vulpinus'' is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling north american [[red-tailed hawk]]. the upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in ''b. b. buteo''.  ==gallery== <gallery> file:common (steppe) buzzard.jpg|b. b. vulpinus, note the pale tail - lake nakuru nat'l park - kenya buteo buteo -hamerton zoo, cambridgeshire, england -head-8a.jpg|at [[hamerton zoo]], england buzzard uk09.jpg|in flight, devon, england. there are around 40,000 [[breeding pair]]s in the united kingdom buteo buteo mwnh 0812.jpg|egg, collection [[museum wiesbaden]] buteo nestling juedischer friedhof.jpg|chicks file:jonge buizerd (buteo buteo).jpg|young buzzard (''buteo buteo'') is provided with a ring. file:ei van een buizerd (buteo buteo) 02.jpg|infertile egg of a buzzard (''buteo buteo''). </gallery>  ==references== <!-- fieldmusnathistzoolser18:343. forktail13:109,16:147. zoolmedleiden82:407. --> {{reflist|refs=  <ref name=crc>{{cite book |title=crc handbook of avian body masses |editor-first=john b. jr. |editor-last=dunning |publisher=crc press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-8493-4258-5}}</ref>  <ref name=linnaeus1758>{{cite book |last=linnaeus |first=c. |authorlink=carl linnaeus |title=systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. tomus i. editio decima, reformata. |location=holmiae (stockholm) |publisher=laurentii salvii |year=1758 |quote=f. cera pedibusque luteis, corpore fusco, abdomine paludo maculis fuscis. |language=la | page=90 | url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726997}}</ref>  <ref name=raptorsworld>{{cite book |last1=ferguson-lees |first1=j. |last2=christie |first2=d. |others=illustrated by kim franklin, david mead & philip burton |title=raptors of the world |year=2001 |publisher=houghton mifflin |isbn=0-618-12762-3}}</ref> }} * {{cite book |last1=mullarney |first1=killian |last2=svensson |first2=lars |last3=zetterstrom |first3=dan |last4=grant |first4=peter |title=collins bird guide |year=1999 |location=london |publisher=harpercollins |isbn=0-00-219728-6}} * {{cite book |first1=ian |last1=sinclair |first2=phil |last2=hockey |first3=warwick |last3=tarboton |title=sasol birds of southern africa |publisher=struik |year=2002 |isbn=1-86872-721-1}}  ==external links== {{commons category|buteo buteo}} {{wikispecies|buteo buteo}} * [http://sabap2.adu.org.za/docs/sabap1/149.pdf steppe buzzard species text in the atlas of southern african birds] * [http://www.madeirabirds.com/buzzard madeira birds: buzzard]. page about the controversial subspecies ''harterti''. retrieved 28 november 2006. * [http://aulaenred.ibercaja.es/wp-content/uploads/119_commonbuzzardbbuteo.pdf ageing and sexing (pdf; 4.2 mb) by javier blasco-zumeta & gerd-michael heinze] * [http://www.ornithos.de/ornithos/feather_collection/buteo_buteo/buteo_buteo.htm feathers of common buzzard (buteo buteo)] * {{birdlife|61695117|buteo buteo}} * {{avibase|name=buteo buteo}} * {{internetbirdcollection|eurasian-buzzard-buteo-buteo|eurasian buzzard}} * {{vireo|common+buzzard}} * {{xeno-canto species|buteo|buteo|common buzzard}}  {{buteoninae}} {{use dmy dates|date=may 2011}} {{taxonbar}}  {{defaultsort:buzzard, common}} [[category:buteo|common buzzard]] [[category:birds of prey]] [[category:birds of europe]] [[category:birds of macaronesia]] [[category:vagrant birds of africa]] [[category:birds described in 1758|common buzzard]]
