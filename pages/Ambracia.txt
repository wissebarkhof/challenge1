of the corinthian tyrant [[cypselus]], at which time its economy was based on farmlands, fishing, timber for shipbuilding, and the exportation of the produce of epirus.<ref name="ocd"/> after the expulsion of gorgus's son periander its government developed into a strong democracy.  the early policy of ambracia was determined by its loyalty to corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the [[epirus]] trade), and its consequent aversion to [[corcyra]] (as ambracia participated on the corinthian side at the [[battle of sybota]], which took place in 433 bc between the rebellious corinthian colony of corcyra (modern corfu) and [[ancient corinth|corinth]]).{{sfn|caspari|1911}}  ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the [[amphilochians]] and [[acarnanians]].  hence it took a prominent part in the [[peloponnesian war]] until the crushing defeat at [[idomene]] (426), which crippled its resources.{{sfn|caspari|1911}}  in the 4th century bc it continued its traditional policy, but in 338 was besieged by [[philip ii of macedon]]. with the assistance of corinth and athens, it escaped complete domination at philip's hands, but was nevertheless forced to accept a macedonian garrison.<ref name="ocd"/>  in 294 bc, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under [[macedon]]ian suzerainty, ambracia was given by the son of [[cassander]] to [[pyrrhus of epirus|pyrrhus]], king of [[epirus (ancient state)|epirus]], who made it his capital, and adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.  in the wars of [[philip v of macedon]] and the epirotes against the [[aetolian league]] (220–205) ambracia passed from one alliance to the other, but ultimately joined the latter confederacy.  during the struggle of the aetolians against [[roman republic|rome]], it stood a stubborn [[siege]],{{sfn|caspari|1911}} including the first known use of [[poison gas]] against the romans' [[tunnel warfare|siege tunnels]].<ref>[[polybius]] 21.28</ref>  ambracia was captured and plundered by [[marcus fulvius nobilior (consul 189 bc)|marcus fulvius nobilior]] in 189 bc, after which it was declared by rome a "free city", and gradually fell into insignificance.<ref name="ocd"/>{{sfn|caspari|1911}}  the foundation by [[augustus caesar|augustus]] of [[nicopolis]], into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted, left the site desolate.  in [[byzantine empire|byzantine]] times a new settlement took its place under the name of [[arta, greece|arta]]. some fragmentary walls of large, well-dressed blocks near this latter town indicate the early prosperity of ambracia.{{sfn|caspari|1911}}  ==ambraciotes==  ===artists=== *[[epigonus of ambracia]], 6th bc musician *nicocles, [[auletes]] *hippasus, tragic
