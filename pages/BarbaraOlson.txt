arts from the [[university of st. thomas (houston)|university of saint thomas]] in houston. she earned a [[juris doctor]] degree from the [[yeshiva university]] [[benjamin n. cardozo school of law]].  ==career== as a newcomer, she achieved a surprising measure of success, working for [[hbo]] and stacy keach productions.{{when|date=may 2012}} in the early 1990s, she worked as an associate at the washington, d.c.-based law firm of [[wilmer cutler & pickering]] where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an [[assistant u.s. attorney]].  olson's support in 1991 of supreme court nominee [[clarence thomas]] led to the formation of the [[independent women's forum]]. at that time, olson and friend [[rosalie (ricky) gaull silberman]] started an informal network of women who supported the thomas nomination to the supreme court despite allegations of sexual harassment by [[anita hill]], a former subordinate of thomas at the [[equal employment opportunity commission]]. olson, who had also worked under thomas at the eeoc and was a close friend of thomas, spoke out on his behalf during his contentious senate confirmation hearings. olson later helped edit ''[[the real anita hill]]'', a book by [[david brock]] that savaged hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political dirty trick (brock later recanted his claims and apologized to hill). the independent women's forum continued on with a goal of retaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility.  in 1994, olson became chief investigative counsel for the [[united states house of representatives|u.s. house of representatives]] [[united states house committee on oversight and government reform|committee on oversight and government reform]]. in that position, she led the [[travelgate]] and [[filegate]] investigations into the clinton administration. she was later a partner in the washington, d.c. office of the [[birmingham,
