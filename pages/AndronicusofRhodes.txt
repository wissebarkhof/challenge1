[[tyrannion of amisus|tyrannion]] commenced this task, but apparently did not do much towards it.<ref>comp. porphyry, ''vit. plotin.'' c. 24; boethius, ''ad aristot. de interpret.''</ref> the arrangement which andronicus made of aristotle's writings seems to be the one which forms the basis of our present editions and we are probably indebted to him for the preservation of a large number of aristotle's works.{{sfn|smith|1870}}  ==writings== andronicus wrote a work upon aristotle, the fifth book of which contained a complete list of the philosopher's writings, and he also wrote commentaries upon the ''physics'', ''ethics'', and ''categories''.  none of these works is extant.  two treatises are sometimes erroneously attributed to him, one ''on emotions'', the other a commentary on aristotle's ''ethics'' (really by [[constantine palaeocapa]] in the 16th century, or by [[john callistus]] of thessalonica).<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=andronicus of rhodes|volume=1 |page=976}}</ref>  ==notes== {{reflist|20em}}  ==references== *{{cite sep |last=falcon |first=andrea |last2=zalta |first2=edward n. |date=8 august 2013 |url-id=aristotle-commentators |title=commentators on aristotle |ref=harv}}  '''attribution''' *{{smithdgrbm|wstitle=andronicus of rhodes}}  ==further reading== *{{cite eb9 |wstitle=andronicus of rhodes |volume=ii |page=23}} *{{cite book |last=barnes |first=jonathan |authorlink=jonathan barnes |chapter=roman aristotle |editor-first=jonathan |editor-last=barnes  |editor2-first=miriam |editor2-last=griffin |title=philosophia togata ii. plato and aristotle at rome |location=new york |publisher=oxford university press, 1997 |pages=1–69 (on andronicus, 24–44)}}  ==external links== * [http://www.ontology.co/corpus-aristotelicum.htm the rediscovery of the corpus aristotelicum] with an annotated bibliography  {{peripatetics}}  {{authority control}}  {{defaultsort:andronicus of rhodes}} [[category:1st-century bc greek people]] [[category:1st-century bc philosophers]] [[category:commentators on aristotle]] [[category:hellenistic-era philosophers]] [[category:roman-era peripatetic philosophers]] [[category:roman-era philosophers in rome]] [[category:roman-era rhodian philosophers]] [[category:ancient greek ethicists]]
