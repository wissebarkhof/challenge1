[[hotel de la monnaie]].]]  outside of the roman province and prior to roman rule, independent gaul was occupied by self-governing tribes divided into cantons, and each canton was further divided into communes.  the aedui, like other powerful tribes in the region (the [[arverni]], the [[sequani]], and the [[helvetii]]), had replaced their monarchy with a council of magistrates called grand-judges.  the grand-judges were under the authority of the senate.  the senate was made up of the descendants of ancient royal families. free men in the tribes were [[vassals]] to the heads of these families in exchange for military, financial and political interests. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=malleson|first1=g.b.|title=vercingetorix|journal=transactions of the royal historical society|date=1889|volume=4|pages=1-40|doi=10.2307/3678158|accessdate=20 january 2017}}</ref>  according to [[livy]] (v. 34), they took part in the expedition of [[bellovesus]] into italy in the 6th century bc.  before [[julius caesar]]'s time, they had attached themselves to the [[ancient rome|romans]] and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the roman people.<ref>{{harvnb|caesar|bg|loc=book i, section 33}}.</ref>  when the [[sequani]], their hereditary rivals, with the assistance of a [[germanic peoples|germanic]] chieftain named [[ariovistus]], defeated and massacred the aedui at the [[battle of magetobriga]], the aedui sent [[diviciacus (aedui)|diviciacus]], the [[druidry|druid]], to rome to appeal to the [[roman senate|senate]] for help, but his mission was unsuccessful.<ref name="eb1911"/>  on his arrival in [[gaul]] (58 bc), caesar restored their independence. in spite of this, the aedui joined the gallic coalition against caesar (''b. g.'' vii. 42), but after the surrender of [[vercingetorix]] at the [[battle of alesia]], were glad to return to their allegiance. [[caesar augustus|augustus]] dismantled{{citation needed|date=may 2009}} their native capital [[bibracte]] on [[mont beuvray]] and substituted a new town with a half-roman, half-gaulish name, augustodunum (modern [[autun]]).  in 21, during the reign of [[tiberius]], they revolted under [[julius sacrovir]], and seized [[augustodunum]], but they were soon put down by gaius silius ([[gaius cornelius tacitus|tacitus]] ''[[annals (tacitus)|ann.]]'' iii. 43-46). the aedui were the first of the gauls to receive from the emperor [[claudius]] the distinction of ''[[jus honorum]]'', thus being the first gauls permitted to become senators.<ref name="test">peoples, nations and cultures. general editor prof john mackenzie. weidenfeld and nicolson. 2005.</ref>  the oration of [[eumenius]], in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected. the chief magistrate of the aedui in caesar's time was called [[vergobretus]] (according to [[theodor mommsen|mommsen]], "judgment-worker"), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier. certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the aedui.<ref name="eb1911"/>  it is possible that the aedui adopted many of the governmental practices of the romans, such as electing magistrates and other officials or perhaps it was a natural development in their political system. it is thought that other celtic tribes, such as the remi and the baiocasses, also elected their leaders.{{citation needed|date=november 2008}}  ==see also== * [[list of peoples of gaul]]  ==notes== {{reflist}}  ==bibliography== *  * {{cite book |first=julius |last=caesar |authorlink=julius caesar |title=[[de bello gallico]] |ref=citerefcaesarbg}} * {{cite book |author=strabo |authorlink=strabo |title=geography |ref=citerefstrabogeography}} *a. e. desjardins, ''geographie de la gaule'', ii.
