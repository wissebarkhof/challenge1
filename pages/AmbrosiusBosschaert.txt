 [[ambrosius bosschaert ii|ambrosius ii]], [[johannes bosschaert|johannes]] and [[abraham bosschaert|abraham]]. his brother-in-law [[balthasar van der ast]] also lived and worked in his workshop and moved with him on his travels. bosschaert later worked in [[amsterdam]] (1614), [[bergen op zoom]] (1615&ndash;1616), [[utrecht]] (1616&ndash;1619), and [[breda]] (1619).<ref name=rkd/> in 1619 when he moved to utrecht, his brother-in-law van der ast entered the utrecht guild of st. luke, where the renowned painter [[abraham bloemaert]] had just become dean. the painter [[roelandt savery]] (1576–1639) entered the st. luke’s guild in utrecht at about the same time. savery had considerable influence on the bosschaert dynasty.<ref name=rkd/> when bosschaert died in [[the hague]] while on commission there for a flower piece, balthasar van der ast took over running his workshop and pupils.<ref name=rkd/>   ==style== [[image:fruit still life with shells.jpg|right|thumb|250px| fruit still life with shells painted by [[balthasar van der ast]].]] his bouquets were painted symmetrically and with scientific accuracy in small dimensions and normally on copper. they sometimes included symbolic and religious meanings. at the time of his death, bosschaert was working on an important commission in the hague.<ref name=rkd/> that piece is now in the collection in stockholm.<ref name=rkd/><ref>[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&database=choiceimages&search=priref=122783 link to stockholm piece] in the rkd</ref> bosschaert became one of the first artists to specialize in still life painting, and he started a tradition of painting detailed flower bouquets, which typically included tulips and roses. thanks to the booming seventeenth-century dutch art market, he became highly successful, as the inscription on one of his paintings attests.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/still_life/bosschaert_1.shtm painting with inscription] at the national gallery</ref>  ===legacy=== his sons and his pupil and brother-in-law, balthasar van der ast, were among those to uphold the bosschaert dynasty which continued until the mid-17th century.  it may not be a coincidence that this trend coincided with a [[tulip mania|national obsession with exotic flowers]] which made flower portraits highly sought after.  although he was highly in demand, he did not create many pieces because he was also employed as an art dealer. ===selected works=== <gallery mode=packed-hover heights=168px caption="selected works"> file:ambrosius bosschaert, the elder 01.jpg|still-life of flowers file:ambrosius bosschaert the elder - bouquet of flowers in a glass vase - google art project.jpg|bouquet of flowers in a glass vase file:ambrosius bosschaert, the elder 02.jpg|still-life of flowers file:bosschaert the elder, still life with flowers in a porcelain vase.jpg|roses, tulips, anemone and cyclamen  in a porcelain vase  file:ambrosius bosschaert - bouquet of flowers on a ledge - google art project.jpg| bouquet of flowers on a ledge file:ambrosius bosschaert, the elder 03.jpg|''[[vase of flowers in a window niche]]'' ([[mauritshuis]]) file:ambrosius bosschaert, the elder 06.jpg|still-life of flowers </gallery>  ==references== {{reflist}} *{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=winkler prins encyclopedia| edition=8 | year=1975 | article=bosschaert de oudere, ambrosius}}  ==external links== {{commons category|ambrosius bosschaert (i)}} *[http://www.artnet.com/artists/ambrosius-bosschaert+the+elder/past-auction-results ambrosius bosschaert] on [[artnet]] * [http://www.kfki.hu/~arthp/html/b/bosschae/ambrosiu/index.html a number of ambrosius bosschaert's paintings]  {{use dmy dates|date=april 2011}}  {{authority control}}  {{defaultsort:bosschaert, ambrosius}} [[category:1573 births]] [[category:1621 deaths]] [[category:flemish baroque painters]] [[category:flower artists]] [[category:dutch golden age painters]] [[category:dutch male painters]] [[category:people from antwerp]] [[category:people from middelburg]] [[category:members of the middelburg guild of saint luke]] [[category:dutch still life painters]] [[category:flemish still life painters]]
