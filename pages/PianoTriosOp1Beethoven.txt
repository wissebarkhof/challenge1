[[ludwig van beethoven]]'s opus 1 is a set of three [[piano trio]]s (written for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello|violoncello]]), first performed in 1795 in the house of [[karl alois johann-nepomuk vinzenz, f√ºrst lichnowsky|prince lichnowsky]], to whom they are dedicated.<ref>[http://www.all-about-beethoven.com/trios.html beethoven's trios for string instruments, wind instruments and for mixed ones.] all about beethoven. retrieved 2011-12-10</ref> the trios were published in 1795.  despite the op. 1 designation, these trios were not beethoven's first published compositions; this  distinction belongs rather to his [[ludwig van beethoven#background and early life|''dressler variations'' for keyboard (woo 63)]]. clearly he recognized these  compositions as the earliest ones he had produced that were substantial enough (and marketable enough) to fill out a first major publication to introduce his style of writing to the musical public.    ==op. 1 no. 1 - piano trio no. 1 in e-flat major== * [[tempo#italian_tempo_markings|allegro]] (e flat major) * [[tempo#italian_tempo_markings|adagio]] cantabile ([[a flat major]]) * [[scherzo]].
