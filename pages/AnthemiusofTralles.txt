'''anthemius of tralles''' ({{lang-grc-gre|ἀνθέμιος ὁ τραλλιανός}}, [[medieval greek]]: {{ipa-el|anˈθemios o traliaˈnos|}}, ''anthémios o trallianós''; {{c.|lk=no|474}}&nbsp;– 533&nbsp;{{abbr|x|sometime between}}&nbsp;558){{sfnp|boyer|1991|p=193}} was a [[ancient greeks|greek]] from [[tralles]] who worked as a [[greek geometry|geometer]] and [[byzantine architecture|architect]] in [[constantinople]], the capital of the [[byzantine empire]]. with [[isidore of miletus]], he designed the [[hagia sophia]] for [[justinian&nbsp;i]]. {{anchor|history|biography}}  ==life== anthemius was one of the five sons of stephanus of tralles, a physician. his brothers were dioscorus, alexander, olympius, and metrodorus. dioscorus followed his father's profession in tralles; alexander did so in [[ancient rome|rome]] and became one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; olympius became a noted [[roman law|lawyer]]; and metrodorus worked as a [[grammarian (greco-roman world)|grammarian]] in constantinople.{{sfn|heath|1911|p=98}}  anthemius was said to have annoyed his neighbor zeno in two ways: first, by engineering a miniature earthquake by sending steam through leather tubes he had fixed among the [[joist]]s and flooring of zeno's parlor while he was entertaining friends and, second, by simulating [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] and flashing intolerable light into zeno's eyes from a slightly hollowed mirror.{{sfn|heath|1911|p=98}} in addition to his familiarity with steam, some dubious authorities credited anthemius with a knowledge of [[gunpowder]] or other explosive compound.{{sfn|heath|1911|p=98}}  ==mathematics== anthemius was a capable [[greek mathematics|mathematician]]. in the course of his treatise "on [[burning glass]]es", intended to facilitate the construction of surfaces to reflect light to a single point, he described the string construction of the [[ellipse]]{{sfnp|boyer|1991|p=193}} and assumed a property of ellipses not found in [[apollonius of perga]]'s ''conics'': the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two tangents drawn from a point. his work also includes the first practical use of the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]: having given the focus and a double ordinate, he used the focus and directrix to obtain any number of points on a [[parabola]].{{sfn|heath|1911|p=98}} this work was later known to [[mathematics in medieval islam|arab mathematicians]] such as [[book of optics|alhazen]].  eutocius's commentary on apollonius's ''conics'' was dedicated to anthemius.{{sfnp|boyer|1991|p=193}} [[file:hagia sophia mars 2013.jpg|thumb|120px|exterior of the [[hagia sophia]], 2013]]  ==architecture== as an architect, anthemius is best known for his work designing the [[hagia sophia]].{{sfn|heath|1911|p=98}} he was commissioned with [[isidore of miletus]] by [[justinian&nbsp;i]] shortly after the earlier church on the site burned down in 532 but died early on in the project. he is also said to have repaired the flood defenses at [[dara (mesopotamia)|daras]].{{citation needed|date=january 2017}}  ==see also== * [[anthemius (disambiguation)|other anthemiuses]]  ==notes== {{reflist|30em}}  ==references== * {{citation |last=boyer |first=carl benjamin |author-link=carl benjamin boyer |title=a history of mathematics |edition=2nd |publisher=john wiley & sons |date=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7 }}.
