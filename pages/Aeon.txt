[[occult]]ists of the [[thelema]] and [[ordo templi orientis|o.t.o.]] traditions sometimes speak of a "magical aeon" that may last for far less time, perhaps as little as 2,000 years.{{citation needed|date=december 2011}}  [[order of nine angles|the order of nine angles]], a uk-based [[left-hand path and right-hand path|left hand path]]/[[satanism|satanic]] organisation propose the concept of aeons are central to the esoteric philosophy developed by the pseudonymous anton long, who wrote that "an aeon is the term used [by the o9a] to describe a stage or a type of evolution. evolution itself is taken to result from a certain speciﬁc process - and this process can be described, or explained [or 're-presented' ] via a bifurcation of time. that is, evolution is an expression of how the cosmos changes over or through or because of,'time' - this 'time' having two components. these two components are the causal and the acausal [...]  "an aeon is a manifestation, in the causal, of a particular type of acausal energy. thisenergy re-orders, or changes, the causal. these changes have certain limits - in bothcausal space and causal time. that is, they have a speciﬁc beginning and a speciﬁcend. a civilization (or rather, a higher or aeonic-civilization) is how this energybecomes ordered or manifests itself in the causal: how this energy is revealed. a civilization represents the practical changes which this energy causes in the causal -in terms of the eﬀect such energy has on individuals and this planet. a civilization is tied to, is born from, a particular aeon. by the nature of this energy, a civilization isan evolution of life - a move toward a more complex, and thus more conscious existence [...]"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/321516646/aeonic-theory-of-the-order-of-nine-angles|title=aeonic theory of the order of nine angles {{!}} causality {{!}} civilization|website=scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref>  aeon may also be an archaic name for omnipotent beings, such as gods.  ===gnosticism=== {{main|aeon (gnosticism)}}  in many [[gnosticism|gnostic]] systems, the various [[emanationism|emanations]] of [[god]], who is also known by such names as the one, the [[monad (gnosticism)|monad]], ''aion teleos'' ({{lang|grc|αἰών τέλεος}} "the broadest aeon"), [[bythos]] ("depth or profundity", greek {{lang|grc|βυθός}}), ''proarkhe'' ("before the beginning", greek {{lang|grc|προαρχή}}), the ''arkhe'' ("the beginning", greek {{lang|grc|ἀρχή}}), "sophia" (wisdom), christos (the anointed one) are called ''aeons''. in the different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described, but the emanation theory itself is common to all forms of gnosticism.  in the [[basilidian]] gnosis they are called sonships (υἱότητες ''huiotetes''; sing.: {{lang|grc|υἱότης}} ''huiotes''); according to [[marcosians|marcus]], they are numbers and sounds; in [[valentinianism]] they form male/female pairs called "syzygies" (greek {{lang|grc|συζυγίαι}}, from σύζυγοι ''syzygoi'').  similarly, in the greek magical papyri, the term "aion" is often used to denote the all, or the supreme aspect of god.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=k0hcj5u3hnqc&pg=pr47&dq=%22the+all+%28aion%29%22&hl=en&sa=x&ei=nek4t4bvnqsm6ggk3pnfcg&ved=0cduq6aewaa#v=onepage&q=%22the%20all%20%28aion%29%22&f=false] h. d. betz, the greek magical papyri in translation, including the demotic spells</ref>  ==see also== *[[aion (deity)]] *[[kalpa (aeon)]] *[[plato]] *[[saeculum]], comparable latin concept  ==references== {{reflist}} {{catholic|wstitle=æons}}  [[category:new testament greek words and phrases]] [[category:units of time]] [[category:latin words and phrases]]
