{{confusing|date=november 2007}}  the '''absolute infinite''' (''symbol'': ω) is an extension of the idea of [[infinity]] proposed by [[mathematician]] [[georg cantor]].  it can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or [[transfinite number|transfinite]].  cantor linked the absolute infinite with [[god]],<ref>§3.2, {{cite journal  | author=ignacio jané  | title=the role of the absolute infinite in cantor's conception of set  | journal=erkenntnis  | volume=42 | issue=3 |date=may 1995 | pages=375–402 | doi=10.1007/bf01129011 | quote=cantor (1) took the absolute to be a manifestation of god [...] when the absolute is first introduced in grundlagen, it is linked to god: "the true infinite or absolute, which is in god, admits no kind of determination" (cantor 1883b, p. 175) this is not an incidental remark, for cantor is very explicit and insistent about the relation between the absolute and god.}}</ref> and believed that it had various [[mathematical]] properties, including the [[reflection principle]]: every property of the absolute infinite is also held by some smaller object.<ref>''infinity: new research and frontiers'' by michael heller and w. hugh woodin (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pvnbigs37wmc&lpg=pp1&pg=pa11#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 11].</ref>  == cantor's view == cantor said:  {{quote|the actual infinite was distinguished by three relations: first, as it is realized in the supreme perfection, in the completely independent, extrawordly existence, in deo, where i call it absolute infinite or simply absolute; second to the extent that it is represented in the dependent, creatural world; third as it can be conceived in abstracto in thought as a mathematical magnitude, number or ordertype. in the latter two relations, where it obviously reveals itself as limited and capable for further proliferation and hence familiar to the finite, i call it ''[[transfinite number|transfinitum]]'' and strongly contrast it with the absolute.<ref>https://www.uni-siegen.de/fb6/phima/lehre/phima10/quellentexte/handout-phima-teil4b.pdf<br/>translated quote from german: {{quote|es wurde das aktual-unendliche (a-u.) nach drei beziehungen unterschieden: erstens, sofern es in der höchsten vollkommenheit, im völlig unabhängigen außerweltlichen sein, in deo realisiert ist, wo ich es absolut unendliches oder kurzweg absolutes nenne; zweitens, sofern es in der abhängigen, kreatürlichen welt vertreten ist; drittens, sofern es als mathematische größe, zahl oder ordnungstypus vom denken in abstracto aufgefaßt werden kann. in den beiden letzten beziehungen, wo es offenbar als beschränktes, noch weiterer vermehrung fähiges und insofern dem endlichen verwandtes a.-u. sich darstellt, nenne ich es ''transfinitum'' und setze es dem absoluten strengstens entgegen.}}[ca-a, p. 378].</ref>}}  cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[richard dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{refn|''gesammelte abhandlungen'',<ref>''gesammelte abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen inhalts'', georg cantor, ed. ernst zermelo, with biography by adolf fraenkel;

such a multiplicity i call for short a "sequence".<br /> <br /> ...<br /> <br /> now i envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''ω''.<br /> <br /> ...<br /> <br /> the system ''ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a "sequence".<br /> now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position;
