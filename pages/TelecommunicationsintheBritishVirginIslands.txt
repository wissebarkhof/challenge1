[[lime (cable & wireless)|''b''mobile]], the cellular arm of cable & wireless, obtained a second.  the third licence was obtained by bvi cable tv, a local cable television service.  the licence in favour of bvi cable was controversial, as the regulator had announced in advance that only three licences in total would be issued, and bvi cable tv had crumbling cable television infrastructure, and was in no position to office cellular telephone services (and to date, has not offered any cellular telephone services, or anything other than simple cable television).  however, ''b''mobile's main regional competitor, [[digicel]], was rejected for a licence.  the decision was regarded as highly controversial in the local media.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2695 bvi platinum news, 23 may 2007] and [http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2782 bvi platinum news, 4 june 2007]</ref>  digicel then issued court proceedings against the regulator, arguing that he had acted improperly by imposing an arbitrary limit of three licences (although interestingly no complaint was made about the decision to prefer bvi cable tv's improbable licence over digicel).  ''b''mobile was joined to the suit as an interested party.  high court judge rita joseph-olivetti found in favour of digicel and quashed the original decision.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2713 bvi platinum news, 25 may 2007]</ref>  digicel commenced separate proceedings against [[cable & wireless plc|cable and wireless]] (as ''b''mobile's parent company) in the [[courts of england and wales|english courts]], claiming that cable & wireless has unfairly stifled competition in several caribbean jurisdictions.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2007/07/070719_phonewars.shtml bbc world news, 19 july 2007]</ref>  during the intervening period, ''b''mobile has obtained a virtual stranglehold on the cellular telecommunications market in the british virgin islands by a combination of low prices and aggressive advertising, as well as significant investment in infrastructure and technology.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2822 bvi platinum news, 8 june 2007] and [http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2959 bvi platinum news, 25 june 2007]</ref>  digicel was finally granted a licence on 17 december 2007 and started operations in the bvi on 28 november 2008.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/bvi/bvi.php?news_id=5061&start=0&category_id=29 caribbean net news: british virgin islands<!-- bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20071221/business/business4.html jamaica gleaner news - digicel to take on two new markets - investing us$15m in bvi roll-out, bids us$80m for honduras licence - friday | 21 december 2007<!-- bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.digicelgroup.com/en/media-center/press-releases/achievements/digicel-launches-in-bvi-with-us17million-investment digicel launches in bvi with us$17 million investment]</ref>  ==references==  {{reflist}} {{cia world factbook}}}  {{north america topic|communications in}} {{telecommunications}}  {{defaultsort:telecommunications in the british virgin islands}} [[category:communications in the british virgin islands| ]] [[category:telecommunications in the caribbean|british virgin]]
