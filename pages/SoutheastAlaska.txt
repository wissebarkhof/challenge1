[[image:alaska panhandle.png|thumb|250px|southeast alaska and [[alaska marine highway]] ferry routes]] '''southeast alaska''', sometimes referred to as the '''alaska panhandle''', is the southeastern portion of the [[u.s. state]] of [[alaska]], which lies west from the northern half of the [[provinces and territories of canada|canadian province]], [[british columbia]]. the majority of southeast alaska's area is part of the [[tongass national forest]], the united states' largest [[united states national forest|national forest]]. in many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[boundary ranges]] of the [[coast mountains]] (see [[alaska boundary dispute]]). the region is noted for its scenery and mild rainy [[climate]].

[[image:tongassforest1.jpg|thumb|right|the [[tongass national forest]], near [[ketchikan]]]] [[image:cruiseshipsketchikan.jpg|thumb|right|cruise ships at ketchikan]]  ==geography==  southeast alaska is the northern terminus of the [[inside passage]], a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in [[puget sound]] in [[washington (state)|washington]] state. this was an important travel corridor for [[tlingit people|tlingit]] and [[haida people|haida]] native peoples, as well as gold-rush era steamships. in modern times it is an important route for [[alaska marine highway]] ferries as well as [[cruise ship]]s.   southeast alaska has a land area of {{convert|35138|sqmi|sqkm}}{{citation needed|date=may 2013}} comprising seven entire [[county-equivalent|borough]]s and two [[census area]]s, in addition to the portion of the [[yakutat city and borough, alaska|yakutat borough]] lying east of [[141st meridian west|141° west]] longitude. although it has only 6.14 percent of alaska's land area, it is larger than the state of [[maine]], and almost as large as the state of [[indiana]]. the southeast alaskan coast is roughly as long as the [[british columbia coast|west coast]] of canada. the [[2010 united states census|2010 census]] population of southeast was 71,616 inhabitants, about 45 percent of whom were concentrated in the city of [[juneau, alaska|juneau]]. *[[haines borough, alaska|haines borough]] *[[hoonah-angoon census area, alaska|hoonah-angoon census area]] *[[juneau city and borough, alaska|juneau borough]]

[[admiralty island national monument]] and [[misty fjords national monument]]), [[glacier bay national park]], [[sitka national historical park]], [[alaska's inside passage]], and myriad large and small islands. the largest islands are, from north to south, [[chichagof island]], [[admiralty island]], [[baranof island]], [[kupreanof island]], [[revillagigedo island]] and [[prince of wales island (alaska)|prince of wales island]]. major bodies of water of southeast alaska include [[glacier bay]], [[lynn canal]], [[icy strait]], [[chatham strait]], [[stephens passage]], [[frederick sound]], [[sumner strait]], and [[clarence strait]].  on august 20, 1902, [[president of the united states|president]] [[theodore roosevelt]] established the [[alexander archipelago forest reserve]], which formed the heart of the [[tongass national forest]] that covers most of the region.  ==national parks and monuments== *[[glacier bay national park and preserve]] *[[klondike gold rush national

system, which extends from northern [[california]] to [[prince william sound]]. the most common tree species are [[sitka spruce]] and [[western hemlock]]. wildlife includes [[brown bear]]s, [[american black bear|black bears]], the endemic [[alexander archipelago wolf]], [[black-tailed deer|sitka black-tailed deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[orca]]s, five species of [[salmon]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, [[scoter]]s, and [[marbled murrelet]]s.  the [https://indd.adobe.com/view/bb243dff-5852-44c5-bdf5-4b1be96bdc53 ecological atlas of southeast alaska], published by audubon alaska in 2016, offers an overview of the region's landscape, birds, wildlife, human uses, climate change, and more, synthesizing data from agencies and a variety of other sources.  ==cities and towns== major cities are [[juneau city and borough, alaska|juneau]], [[ketchikan, alaska|ketchikan]], and [[sitka city and borough, alaska|sitka]]. other towns are [[petersburg, alaska|petersburg]], [[wrangell, alaska|wrangell]], [[metlakatla, alaska|metlakatla]], [[haines, alaska|haines]], [[hoonah, alaska|hoonah]], [[angoon, alaska|angoon]], [[kake, alaska|kake]], [[craig, alaska|craig]], [[klawock, alaska|klawock]], [[thorne bay, alaska|thorne bay]], [[yakutat, alaska|yakutat]], [[skagway, alaska|skagway]], and [[gustavus, alaska|gustavus]]. there are also many towns and villages with around 100 people, such as [[baranof warm springs, alaska|baranof warm springs]], [[edna bay, alaska|edna bay]], [[elfin cove, alaska|elfin cove]], [[excursion inlet, alaska|excursion inlet]],

[[file:raventotemsitka.jpg|thumb|right|totem pole at [[sitka national historical park]]]] this area is the traditional homeland of the [[tlingit people|tlingit]], and home of a historic settling of [[haida people|haida]] as well as a modern settlement of [[tsimshian]]. the region is closely connected to [[seattle]] and the american [[pacific northwest]] economically and culturally.  in modern times, southeastern alaskans can often be identified by their fashion choices, notably [[xtratuf]] boots, and "shirtjacs" (a garment having aspects of both [[shirt]] and [[jacket]]).

[[logging]] has been an important industry in the past, but has been steadily declining with competition from other areas and the closure of the region's major pulp mills; the alaska forest association described the situation as "desperate" in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskajournal.com/business-and-finance/2011-11-03/ak-forest-association-se-timber-situation-desperate|title=ak

united states, canada and the [[united kingdom]] and british columbia claimed different borderlines at the alaskan panhandle. while the british foreign affairs were in favour of support of the canadian argument, the event resulted in what was thought of as a betrayal, leading to [[alaska_boundary_dispute#canadian_controversy|alienation of the british]] from the new nation of [[canada]].

alaska|hyder]], [[skagway]], and [[haines, alaska|haines]]) have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. the [[alaska marine highway]] passes through this region.  ===air transportation=== [[alaska airlines]] is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with juneau's [[juneau international airport]] serving as the aerial hub for all of southeast and ketchikan's [[ketchikan international airport]] serving as a secondary hub for southern southeast alaska. alaska's [[bush aviation|bush airlines ]] and [[air taxi]]s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. many communities are accessible by air only by [[floatplane]], as proper runways are often difficult to construct on the steep island slopes.  ===marine transportation=== southeast alaska is primarily served by the state-run [[alaska marine highway]], which links skagway, haines, [[hoonah, alaska|hoonah]], [[juneau]], [[sitka, alaska|sitka]], [[petersburg, alaska|petersburg]], [[wrangell, alaska|wrangell]], [[ketchikan, alaska|ketchikan]] and other outlying communities with [[prince rupert, bc]] and [[bellingham, washington]]; and secondarily by the [[prince of wales island (alaska)|prince of wales island]]-based [[inter-island ferry authority]], which provides the only scheduled passenger and auto ferry service to the island. a new authority, the rainforest islands ferry authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the north end route. the authority would connect coffman cove with wrangell and petersburg. small companies like sitka-based allen marine and other independent operators in the [[lynn canal]] occasionally also offer marine passenger service. ship traffic in the area is seasonally busy with [[cruise ship]]s.  ==see also== *[[alexander archipelago]] *[[alexander archipelago wolf]] *[[climate change in southeast alaska]] *[[list of edible plants and mushrooms of
