'''apollinarism''' or '''apollinarianism''' was a view proposed by [[apollinaris of laodicea]] (died 390) that [[jesus]] could not have had a human mind; rather,  jesus had a [[human]] body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a [[god|divine]] mind.   the [[trinity]] had been recognized at the council of nicea in 325, but debate about exactly what it meant continued. a rival to the more common belief that jesus christ had two natures was [[monophysitism]] ("one nature"), the doctrine that christ had only one nature. apollinarism and [[eutychianism]] were two forms of monophysitism. apollinaris' rejection that christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to [[arianism]] and its teaching that christ was not divine.<ref>mcgrath, alister. 1998.

[[basil of caesarea]] accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. his views were condemned in a [[synod]] at [[alexandria]], under [[athanasius of alexandria]], in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the [[polemian]]s and the [[antidicomarianite]]s.  it was declared to be a [[christian heresy|heresy]] in 381 by the [[first council of constantinople]], since christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully god. followers of apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a [[tertium quid]] ("third thing," neither god nor man).  apollinaris further taught, following [[tertullian]], that the [[soul (spirit)|soul]]s of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies (see [[traducianism]]). {{citation needed|date=october 2010}}  christian philosopher [[william lane craig]] has proposed a neo-apollinarian christology in which the divine logos completes the human nature of christ. craig says his proposal is tentative and he welcomes critique and interaction from other scholars.<ref>william lane craig and j.p. moreland. 2003.
