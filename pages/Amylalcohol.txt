an '''amyl alcohol''' is any of 8 [[alcohols]] with the formula c<sub>5</sub>h<sub>11</sub>oh.<ref>[[merriam-webster's collegiate dictionary]] 11th ed. 2004</ref> a mixture of amyl alcohols (also called amyl alcohol) can be obtained from [[fusel alcohol]]. amyl alcohol is used as a solvent and in [[esterfication]], by which is produced [[amyl acetate]] and other important products. the name ''amyl alcohol'' without further specification applies to the normal (straight-chain) form, [[1-pentanol|1-pentanol]].  these are the 8 [[structural isomer]]s of alcohols with [[molecular formula]] c<sub>5</sub>h<sub>12</sub>o:  :{| class="wikitable sortable" |+'''amyl alcohol isomers''' |- ! common name !! structure !! type !!
