[https://books.google.com/books?id=uydjaaaayaaj&pg=pa11#v=onepage&q&f=false on page 11], wollaston coins the term "bicarbonate":  "the next question that occurs relates to the composition of this crystallized carbonate of potash, which i am induced to call bi-carbonate of potash, for the purpose of marking more decidedly the distinction between this salt and that which is commonly called a subcarbonate, and in order to refer at once to the double dose of carbonic acid contained in it."</ref>  the prefix "bi" in "bicarbonate" comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much [[carbonate]] ({{chem|co|3|2-}}) per sodium ion in [[sodium bicarbonate]] (nahco<sub>3</sub>) and other bicarbonates than in [[sodium carbonate]] (na<sub>2</sub>co<sub>3</sub>) and other carbonates.<ref>http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem99/chem99492.htm</ref> the name lives on as a [[trivial name]].  ==chemical properties==  the bicarbonate ion (hydrogencarbonate ion) is an [[anion]] with the [[empirical formula]] {{chem|hco|3|-}} and a molecular mass of 61.01&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|daltons]]; it consists of one central carbon [[atom]] surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens. it is [[isoelectronic]] with [[nitric acid]]&nbsp;{{chem|hno|3}}. the bicarbonate ion carries a negative one [[formal charge]] and is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of [[carbonic acid]]&nbsp;{{chem|h|2|co|3}}; at the same time, it is the [[conjugate acid]] of {{chem|co|3|2−}}, the [[carbonate]] ion, as shown by these [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:  :{{chem|co|3|2−}} + 2 h<sub>2</sub>o {{eqm}} {{chem|hco|3|-}} + h<sub>2</sub>o + oh<sup>−</sup> {{eqm}} h<sub>2</sub>co<sub>3</sub> + 2  oh<sup>−</sup>  :h<sub>2</sub>co<sub>3</sub> + 2 h<sub>2</sub>o {{eqm}} {{chem|hco|3|-}} + h<sub>3</sub>o<sup>+</sup> + h<sub>2</sub>o {{eqm}} {{chem|co|3|2−}} + 2 h<sub>3</sub>o<sup>+</sup>.  a bicarbonate salt forms when a [[cation|positively charged ion]] attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an [[ionic compound]]. many bicarbonates are [[solubility|soluble]] in [[aqueous solution|water]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]]; in particular, sodium bicarbonate contributes to [[total dissolved solids]], a common parameter for assessing [[water quality]].{{citation needed|date=march 2011}}  ==physiological role== [[file:riassorbimento bicarbonati e respirazione cellulare.svg|450px|thumbnail|left|co<sub>2</sub> produced as a waste product of the oxidation of sugars in the mitochondria reacts with water in a reaction catalyzed by [[carbonic anhydrase]] to form h<sub>2</sub>co<sub>3</sub>, which is in equilibrium with the cation h<sup>+</sup> and anion hco<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. it is then carried to the lung, where the reverse reaction occurs and co<sub>2</sub> gas is released. in the kidney (left), cells (green) lining the proximal tubule conserve bicarbonate by transporting it from the glomerular filtrate in the lumen (yellow) of the nephron back into the blood (red). the exact stoichiometry in the kidney is omitted for simplicity.]]{{clear left}} bicarbonate ({{chem|hco|3|-}}) is [[alkaline]], and a vital component of the [[ph]] [[buffer solution|buffering system]]<ref name="veq" /> of the human body (maintaining [[acid–base homeostasis]]). 70–75% of co<sub>2</sub> in the body is converted into [[carbonic acid]] (h<sub>2</sub>co<sub>3</sub>), which can quickly turn into bicarbonate.  with carbonic acid as the [[reaction intermediate|central intermediate]] [[chemical species|species]], bicarbonate – in conjunction with water, [[hydronium|hydrogen ions]], and [[carbon dioxide]] – forms this buffering system, which is maintained at the volatile equilibrium<ref name="veq" /> required to provide prompt resistance to ph changes in both the acidic and [[base (chemistry)|basic]] directions. this is especially important for protecting [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[central nervous system]], where ph changes too far outside of the normal range in either direction could prove disastrous (see [[acidosis]] or [[alkalosis]]).  bicarbonate also acts to regulate ph in the small intestine. it is released from the [[pancreas]] in response to the hormone [[secretin]] to neutralize the acidic [[chyme]] entering the duodenum from the stomach.<ref>berne & levy, ''principles of physiology''</ref>  ==bicarbonate in the environment== bicarbonate is the dominant form of [[total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] in sea water,<ref>{{cite web|title=the chemistry of ocean acidification : ocb-oa|url=http://www.whoi.edu/ocb-oa/page.do?pid=112136|website=www.whoi.edu|publisher=woods hole oceanographic institution|accessdate=17 may 2017|language=en-nz|date=24 september 2012}}</ref> and in most fresh waters. as such it is an important sink in the [[carbon cycle]].  in freshwater ecology, strong [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity by freshwater plants in daylight releases gaseous [[oxygen]] into the water and at the same time produces bicarbonate ions. these shift the ph upward until in certain circumstances the degree of alkalinity can become toxic to some organisms or can make other chemical constituents such as [[ammonia]] toxic. in darkness, when no photosynthesis occurs, respiration processes release carbon dioxide, and no new bicarbonate ions are produced, resulting in a rapid fall in ph.  ==other uses== the most common salt of the bicarbonate ion is [[sodium bicarbonate]], nahco<sub>3</sub>, which is commonly known as [[baking soda]]. when heated or exposed to an [[acid]] such as [[acetic acid]] ([[vinegar]]), sodium bicarbonate releases [[carbon dioxide]]. this is used as a [[leavening agent]] in [[baking]].  the flow of bicarbonate ions from rocks weathered by the carbonic acid in rainwater is an important part of the [[carbon cycle]].  bicarbonate also serves much in the digestive system.  it raises the internal ph of the stomach, after highly acidic digestive juices have finished in their digestion of food. [[ammonium bicarbonate]] is used in [[digestive biscuit]] manufacture.  ==diagnostics== in [[diagnostic medicine]], the [[blood value]] of bicarbonate is one of several indicators of the state of [[acid–base physiology]] in the body. it is measured, along with [[carbon dioxide]], [[chloride]], [[potassium]], and [[sodium]], to assess [[electrolyte]] levels in an [[electrolyte panel]] test (which has [[current procedural terminology]], cpt, code 80051).  the parameter ''standard bicarbonate concentration'' (sbc<sub>e</sub>) is the bicarbonate concentration in the blood at a [[paco2|p<sub>a</sub>co<sub>2</sub>]] of {{convert|40|mmhg|kpa|2|abbr=on}}, full oxygen saturation and 36&nbsp;°c.<ref>[http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u13/u1312_03.htm acid base balance (page 3)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613020114/http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u13/u1312_03.htm |date=2002-06-13 }}</ref>  [[file:reference ranges for blood tests - by molarity.png|thumb|550px|center|[[reference ranges for blood tests]], comparing blood content of bicarbonate (shown in blue at right) with other constituents.]]  == bicarbonate compounds ==  * [[sodium bicarbonate]] * [[potassium bicarbonate]] * [[caesium bicarbonate]] * [[magnesium bicarbonate]] * [[calcium bicarbonate]] * [[ammonium bicarbonate]] * [[carbonic acid]]  ==see also==  * [[carbon dioxide]] * [[carbonate]] * [[carbonic anhydrase]] * [[hard water]] * [[arterial blood gas]]  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==external links== {{wiktionary}} * {{meshname|bicarbonates}}  {{oxides of carbon}} {{clinical biochemistry blood tests}} {{carbon compounds}}  [[category:anions]] [[category:bicarbonates| ]]
