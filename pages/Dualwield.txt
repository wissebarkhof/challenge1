[[file:mongolian armed forces 100711-a-ce583-114.jpg|thumb|250px|mongolian soldiers dual-wielding knives during skills display]] '''dual wielding''' is using two [[weapon]]s, one in each hand, during [[combat]]. it is not a common combat practice. although historical records of dual wielding in [[war]] are limited, there are numerous [[martial arts#variation and scope|weapon-based martial arts]] that involve the use of a pair of weapons. the use of a [[companion weapon]] is sometimes employed in [[european martial arts]] and fencing, such as a parrying dagger. [[miyamoto musashi]], a [[japan|japanese]] swordsman and ''[[ronin]]'', was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords.  in terms of [[firearm]]s and [[handgun]]s, this style has been popularized by [[television]], but is generally denounced by firearm enthusiasts due to its impracticality.{{citation needed|reason=claim regarding firearm enthusiasts likely to be challenged|date=october 2016}} though using two hand guns at a time confers an advantage by allowing more ready ammunition, it is rarely done due to other aspects of weapons handling. dual wielding is present in many films and video games, which have the freedom of ignoring the impracticality of the style. the term itself is often invoked in the context of games.  ==history== dual wielding has not been used or mentioned much in military history, though it appears in [[martial arts#variation and scope|weapon based martial arts]] and [[fencing]] practices.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0pcagaaqbaj|title=schools and masters of fencing: from the middle ages to the eighteenth century|last=castle|first=egerton|date=2012-06-19|publisher=courier corporation|isbn=9780486138756|page=51|language=en}}</ref> this style of combat requires special training, since an untrained user is unable to swing both weapons at the same time. to perform an attack by the defensive weapon after the first, the user needs to perform a separate and distinct action.<ref name="swordfightinstarwars">{{cite book | author=nick jamilla | title=sword fighting in the star wars universe: historical origins, style and philosophy | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g23d4ymmdb0c&pg=pa202 | accessdate=12 june 2013 | date=1 january 2008 | publisher=mcfarland | isbn=978-0-7864-5179-1 | page=257}}</ref> the main advantage of using two weapons is the user can use one as a holding weapon after contact is made and use the other to attack the open area of the opponent. otherwise, there is not much advantage compared to a user who wields a single weapon with both hands in terms of power and control. the latter has more maneuverability due to a more controlled [[center of gravity]]; a person using a single weapon can use their legs for kicking or tripping. a single-handed grip on each weapon also means it can be knocked away with a sufficiently powerful blow.<ref name="swordfightinstarwars"/>  the use of weapon combinations in each hand has been mentioned for close combat in western europe during the [[byzantine]],<ref name="byzantine">{{cite book|author=tim dawson phd|title=byzantine infantryman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o14p5hpv8wac&printsec=frontcover&dq=byzantine+osprey+dawson&hl=en&sa=x&ei=rjjzuz7rbakdiaklp4docq&ved=0cc0q6aewaa#v=onepage&q=byzantine%20osprey%20dawson&f=false|accessdate=12 june 2013|date=7 september 2010|publisher=osprey publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-105-2|page=48}}</ref> [[medieval]], and [[renaissance era]].<ref name="shacklefordspiritofsword">{{cite book|author=steve shackleford|title=spirit of the sword: a celebration of artistry and craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pklamkl09l8c|accessdate=12 june 2013|date=7 september 2010|publisher=adams media|isbn=978-1-4402-1638-1|page=48}}</ref> the use of a [[parrying dagger]] such as a main gauche along with a [[rapier]] is common in historical european martial arts.<ref name="oxford medieval warfare">{{cite book|author=clifford rogers|title=the oxford encyclopaedia of medieval warfare and military technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzwpq6blhhmc|accessdate=12 june 2013|date=june 2010|publisher=oxford university press|isbn=978-0-19-533403-6|page=240}}</ref>  traditional schools of [[japanese martial arts]] include dual wield techniques, particularly a style conceived by [[miyamoto musashi]] involving the [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]], two-sword [[kenjutsu]] techniques he called ''[[niten ichi-ryū]]''.

[[okinawan martial arts]] have a method that uses a pair of [[sai (weapon)|''sai'']].  [[chinese martial arts]] involve the use of a pair of [[butterfly swords]] and [[hook sword]]s. [[gatka]], a weapon-based martial art from the [[punjab region]], is known to use two sticks at a time. the thailand weapon-based martial art [[krabi krabong]] involves the use of a separate [[krabi (sword)|''krabi'']] in each hand. [[kalaripayattu]] teaches advanced students to use either two sticks (of various sizes) or two daggers or two swords, simultaneously.   it should be noted that all the above-mentioned examples, involve either one long and one short weapon, or two short weapons.  an example of a dual wield of two sabres is the ukrainian cossack dance [[hopak]].  ==modern times== [[file:alison carroll 20080927 festival du jeu video 02.jpg|thumb|model dressed as [[lara croft]] dual wielding pistols]] in modern terms, the use of a gun in each hand is most associated with the [[american old west]], mainly due to media portrayals. some people of the era preferred to carry two guns, but not to use them at the same time, as shown in movies,<ref name="oldwestfactorfilm">{{cite book|author=jeremy agnew | title=the old west in fact and film: history versus hollywood | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_mrctrycvsc | accessdate=12 june 2013 | year=2012 | publisher=mcfarland | isbn=978-0-7864-9311-1 | page=170}}</ref> but rather to use the second one, instead of having to take the time to reload the first. the second handgun was rarely used in the manner portrayed especially in movies and video games.
