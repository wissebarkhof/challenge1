''alex'' also accommodates the [[park inn berlin]] and the [[world clock|world time clock]], a continually rotating installation that shows the time throughout the globe, and [[hermann henselmann]]'s ''haus des lehrers''. during the [[peaceful revolution]] of 1989, the [[alexanderplatz demonstration]] on 4 november was the largest demonstration in the history of east germany.  ===after german reunification=== ever since [[german reunification]], alexanderplatz has undergone a gradual process of change with many of the surrounding buildings being renovated. despite the reconstruction of the [[berlin straßenbahn|tram]] line crossing, it has retained its socialist character, including the much-[[graffiti]]ed "fountain of friendship between peoples" (''brunnen der völkerfreundschaft''), a popular venue.  in 1993, architect [[hans kollhoff]]'s master plan for a major redevelopment including the construction of several skyscrapers was published.<ref name="bloomberg1">dalia fahmy (may 27, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-26/25-years-after-communism-eyesores-spur-landmark-debate.html "25 years after communism, eyesores spur landmark debate"] ''[[the wall street journal]]''.</ref> due to a lack of demand it is unlikely these will be constructed, with the exception (announced january 2014) of a 39-storey residential tower designed by frank gehry on which work is expected to begin in 2015. however, beginning with the reconstruction of the ''[[metro ag|kaufhof]]'' department store in 2004, and the biggest underground railway station of berlin, some buildings will be redesigned and new structures built on the square's south-eastern side. sidewalks were expanded to shrink one of the avenues, a new underground garage was built, and commuter tunnels meant to keep pedestrians off the streets were removed.<ref name="bloomberg1"/> the surrounding buildings now house chain stores, fast-food restaurants, and fashion discounters.<ref name="bloomberg1"/> the ''alexa'' shopping mall, with approximately 180 stores opened nearby during 2007 and a large ''saturn'' electronic store was built and is open on alexanderplatz since 2008. the cubix [[multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema, which opened in november 2000, joined in 2007 the team of [[berlin international film festival|berlinale]] cinemas and the festival is showing films on three of its screens.<ref>[http://www.berlinale.de/en/programm/spielst_tten/kinos/index.html berlinale venues]</ref>  many historic buildings are located in the vicinity of alexanderplatz. the traditional seat of city government, the [[rotes rathaus]], or ''red city hall'',  is located nearby, as was the former east german parliament building, the [[palast der republik]], demolition of which began in february 2006 and has been completed. the reconstruction of the baroque [[stadtschloss, berlin|stadtschloss]] near alexanderplatz has been in planning for several years.<ref>http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,594515,00.html</ref>  alexanderplatz is also the name of the [[berlin alexanderplatz railway station|s-bahn]] and [[alexanderplatz (berlin u-bahn)|u-bahn]] stations there. it is one of berlin's largest and most important transportation hubs, being a meetingplace of three subway (u-bahn) lines, three s-bahn lines, and many tram and bus lines, as well as regional trains.  ==image gallery== <gallery widths="150"> file:weltzeituhr.jpg|the [[world clock]] with the [[fernsehturm berlin|fernsehturm]] in the background file:bahnhof berlin-alexanderplatz.jpg|[[berlin alexanderplatz station|bahnhof alexanderplatz]] file:berlin alexanderplatz - alexanderhaus 1.jpg|alexanderhaus file:project-blinkenlights-aerial-view.jpg|project blinkenlights file:berlin tv tower reflection.jpg|[[park inn berlin|park inn]] with a reflection from the [[fernsehturm berlin|fernsehturm]]. file:die mitte alexanderplatz imgp1725.jpg|shopping mall ''die mitte'' file:berlin alexanderplatz abend.jpg|bahnhof alexanderplatz and the fernsehturm file:apstatue.jpg|[[neptunbrunnen]] file:alexplatz1.jpg|tram at alexanderplatz file:alexanderplatz 01.jpg|[[fernsehturm berlin|fernsehturm]] on "alex" file:urania-weltzeituhr auf dem alexanderplatz in berlin 2015 weitwinkel.jpg|the [[world clock]] and [[park inn berlin|park inn]] hotel in the background </gallery>  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== * weszkalnys, gisa (2010).
