{{about|the amati family of luthiers|the proposed automobile marque|amati cars|the [[romania]]n village of amaţi|păuleşti, satu mare}} '''amati''' is the last name of a family of [[italy|italian]] [[violin]] makers, who lived at [[cremona]] from about 1538 to 1740.  their importance is considered equal to those of the [[carlo bergonzi (luthier)|bergonzi]], [[guarneri]] and [[stradivarius|stradivari]] families. today, violins created by nicolò amati are valued at around $600,000.<ref>[http://www.violinadvisor.com/pricehistory.htm violin price histories], violinadvisor.com, accessed 18 martie 2014</ref>  ==family members==  ===andrea amati=== {{main|andrea amati}} '''andrea amati''' ({{circa|1505}}{{snd}}{{circa|1578}}) designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the "violin family". he standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. makers from nearby [[brescia]] experimented, such as gasparo da salò, micheli, zanetto and pellegrino, but it was andrea amati in cremona, italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.  the first violin was ordered by [[lorenzo de medici|lorenzo de' medici]] in 1555. his letter to amati stated the instrument was to be "made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play". the first violin was intended to be used by illiterate musicians, so the design was simple and it was easy to play. what became of this first violin is not known. a number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (amati made the first cello called "the king" in 1538 [1]) and 1574. the largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by [[catherine de medici|catherine de médicis]] the regent queen of france and bore hand painted royal french decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son [[charles ix of france]]. of these 38 instruments ordered, amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. they were in use until the french revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. his work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design. <ref>dilworth, john.

"the brothers amati", as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the [[f-holes]]. they are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of [[viola]], in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that [[gasparo da salo]] made violas ranging from altos of 39&nbsp;cm to tenors of 44.7&nbsp;cm.  ===nicolo amati=== {{main|nicolò amati}} '''nicolò amati''' (december 3, 1596{{snd}}april 12, 1684) was the son of girolamo amati. he was the most eminent of the family. he improved the model adopted by the rest of the amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of [[timbre|tone]].<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=amati|volume=1|page=783}}</ref> his pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the "grand amati", which have become his most sought-after violins.  of his pupils, the most famous were [[antonio stradivari]] and [[andrea guarneri]],<ref name="eb1911"/> the first of the guarneri family of violin makers. (there is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of antonio stradivari. while the label on stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.)  ===girolamo amati (hieronymus ii)=== the last maker of the family was nicolò's son, '''girolamo amati''', known as '''hieronymus ii''' (february 26, 1649{{snd}}february 21, 1740). although he improved on the arching of his father's instruments, by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day, antonio stradivari.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=july 2012}}  ==extant amati instruments== ===united kingdom=== instruments in the uk include andrea amati violins from the set delivered to [[charles ix of france]] in 1564. * amati instruments at the [[ashmolean museum]], oxford.[http://www.amati.com/magazine/107-instrument-articles/feature/] * andrea amati ** [http://www.ashmoleanprints.com/image/1056126/andrea-amati-violin-charles-ix-1564 violin, 1564 (ex–french royal collection)] ** viola * amati instruments at the [[royal academy of music museum]], london * amati instrument at the [[tullie house museum and art gallery]], [[carlisle, cumbria|carlisle]] * andrea amati ** [http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/objects/amati-violin violin, 1564 (ex french royal collection)]  ===united states=== [[image:andrea amati violin - met museum ny.jpg|thumb|this violin, now at the [[metropolitan museum of art]], may have been part of a set made for the marriage of philip ii of spain to elisabeth of valois in 1559, which would make it one of the earliest known violins in existence.]] <!-- the nmm web page lacks a centralized list of amati instruments in their collection, so they are linked individually --> * amati instruments at the [[national music museum]] (university of south dakota)[http://www.usd.edu/smm/]: ** andrea amati: *** "the king", circa 1545, the world's oldest extant cello *** viola, 1560 *** violin, 1560 *** violin, 1574 ** girolamo amati: *** [[hieronymus ii double bass|double bass, 1680]] *** [http://www.usd.edu/smm/violins/amati3423/3423amativiolin.html violin, 1604] *** [http://www.usd.edu/smm/violins/amati3364/hamativiolin.html violin, 7/8-size, 1609] *** [http://www.usd.edu/smm/violins/amativiolinopiccolo/3361violinopiccolo.html violino piccolo, 1613] ** nicolò amati: *** [http://www.usd.edu/smm/violins/amatinicolo/3356namativiolin.html violin, 1628] <!-- end of nmm section --> *amati instruments at the (new york) [[metropolitan museum of art]] **andrea amati: *** [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/eustn/ho_1999.26.htm violin, {{circa|1560}}] ** nicolò amati: *** [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/strd/ho_1974.229.htm violin, 1669]  ==in popular culture== * [[patrick o'brian]]'s fictional british sea captain [[jack aubrey]] is described as owning a "fiddle far above his station, an amati no less", in ''the surgeon's mate.'' in the ''wine-dark sea'', book fifteen of the series, [[stephen maturin]] now has a girolamo amati and aubrey a [[guarneri]]. * in satyajit ray's short story ''bosepukure khoonkharapi'', the fictional detective [[feluda]] deduces that a character was murdered because he owned an amati violin. * in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series [[gunslinger girl]], [[henrietta (gunslinger)|henrietta]] carries an amati violin case. it contains a [[fn p90|fabrique nationale p90]] when on a mission, otherwise it contains a real violin. * on the radio show, ''yours truly, johnny dollar'', the january 1956 episode "the ricardo amerigo matter" centered on a stolen amati violin.  ==see also== * [[antonio stradivari]] * [[amati quartet]] * [[dom nicolò amati]] (1662–1752), italian luthier not part of this family but who adopted this surname * [[luthier]] * [[san maurizio, venice]]  ==notes== {{reflist}}  ==references== *dilworth, john (1992), "the violin and bow-origins and development" in: ''the cambridge companion to the violin'', ed. robin stowell. cambridge: cambridge university press, pp.&nbsp;1–29.  ==external links== *[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/08/eustn/ho_1999.26.htm  andrea amati: violin, heilbrunn timeline of art history, the metropolitan museum of art] *[http://www.mimo-international.com/mimo/search.aspx?instance=exploitation&sc=default&query=amati+cremona&_lg=en-us# instruments of the amati family on the online database mimo], website mimo-international.com.  {{defaultsort:amati}} [[category:amati instruments]] [[category:bowed string instrument makers]] [[category:italian families]] [[category:italian musical instrument makers]] [[category:luthiers]] [[category:articles about multiple people]]
