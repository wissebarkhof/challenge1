azure semé-de-lis or dimidiating gules semé of castles or'']]  aside from the crusades, alphonse stayed primarily in paris, governing his estates by officials, inspectors who reviewed the officials work, and a constant stream of messages.<ref>petit-dutaillis. pp. 299-300.</ref> his main work was on his own estates. there he repaired the evils of the [[albigensian crusade|albigensian war]] and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. the charter known as "alphonsine," granted to the town of [[riom]], became the code of public law for [[auvergne (province)|auvergne]]. honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money.{{sfn|chisholm|1911}}  he is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of [[jew]]s, when he did so in poitou in 1249.  when louis ix again engaged in a crusade (the [[eighth crusade]]), alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother.<ref>strayer. p. 511.</ref> this time, however, he did not return to france, dying while on his way back, probably at [[savona]] in italy, on 21 august 1271.  ==death and legacy== alphonse's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands. one possibility was that they should revert to the crown, another that they should be redistributed to his family. the latter was claimed by charles of anjou, but in 1283 [[parlement]] decided that the county of toulouse should revert to the crown, if there were no male heirs.<ref name="wptmus"/> alphonse's wife joan (who died four days after alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. joan was the only surviving child and heiress of [[raymond vii]], count of toulouse, duke of narbonne, and marquis of provence, so under provençal and french law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. but, her will was invalidated by parlement in 1274.<ref name="wptmus"/> one specific bequest in alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the [[comtat venaissin]] to the [[holy see]], was allowed, and it became a [[papal states|papal territory]], a status that it retained until 1791.  ==see also== {{portal bar|biography|france}} * [[abraham
