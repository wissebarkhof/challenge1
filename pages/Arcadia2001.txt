[[colecovision]]. it was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released.<ref name="watcher reviews">{{cite web|last=watcher|first=dark|title=emerson arcadia 2001 - dw

released it in japan.<ref name="watcher reviews"/> over 30 arcadia 2001 clones exist.  the unrelated arcadia corporation, manufacturer of the atari 2600 [[starpath supercharger|supercharger]] add-on, was sued by emerson for trademark infringement. arcadia corporation then changed its name to [[starpath]].<ref name="starpath">[http://thedoteaters.com/?bitstory=epyx the dot eaters - epyx | the dot

and is powered by a standard 12-volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. it also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.  the system came with two [[intellivision]]-style controllers with a 12 button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. the direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. most games came with [[bopet]] overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. the console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.  there are at least three different types of cartridge case styles<ref>[http://www.obsoletemedia.org/emerson-arcadia-2001/ obsoletemedia.org: emerson arcadia 2001 (1982 – 1984)]</ref> and artwork, with variations on each. emerson-family cartridges come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.  ==technical specifications== *main processor: [[signetics 2650]] cpu  **some variants run a [[signetics]] 2650a *ram:

the arcadia, but never had them manufactured as atari started to sue its competitor companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements.<ref>{{cite
