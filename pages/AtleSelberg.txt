'''atle selberg''' (14 june 1917 – 6 august 2007) was a norwegian [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[analytic number theory]], and in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s, in particular bringing them into relation with [[spectral theory]]. he was awarded the [[fields medal]] in 1950.  == early years == selberg was born in [[langesund]], norway, the son of teacher anna kristina selberg and mathematician [[ole michael ludvigsen selberg]]. two of his brothers also went on to become mathematicians as well, and the remaining one became a professor of engineering.  <!-- there seems to be no source for the following anecdote, and the reference given does not mention selberg: his first result came at age 14 when he found[[johann bernoulli]]'s  remarkable 1697 formula :<math>\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n} = \int_0^1 x^{-x} dx\quad\quad(=1.291285997...)</math> which he published as a problem in the book ''problems and theorems in analysis'' (part i, problem 160) by [[pólya]] and [[gábor szegö]]. --> while he was still at school he was influenced by the work of [[srinivasa ramanujan]] and he found an exact analytical formula for the [[partition (number theory)#partition function|partition function]] as suggested by the works of ramanujan; however, this result was first published by [[hans rademacher]]. during the war he fought against the german invasion of norway, and was imprisoned several times.  he studied at the [[university of oslo]] and completed his [[ph.d.]] in 1943.  == world war ii == during [[world war ii]], selberg worked in isolation due to the [[german occupation of norway]]. after the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the [[riemann zeta function]] lie on the line <math>\re(s)=\tfrac{1}{2}</math>.    after the war, he turned to [[sieve theory]], a previously neglected topic which selberg's work brought into prominence. in a 1947 paper he introduced the [[selberg sieve]], a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to [[chen's theorem]], among other important results.  in 1948 selberg submitted two papers in ''[[annals of mathematics]]'' in which he proved by elementary means the theorems for [[primes in arithmetic progression]] and the [[prime number theorem|density of primes]].<ref>{{cite

only obtainable with the advanced methods of [[complex analysis]]. both results were based on his work on the asymptotic formula :<math>\vartheta \left( x \right)\log \left( x \right) + \sum\limits_{p \le x} {\log \left( p \right)} \vartheta \left( {\frac{x}{p}} \right) = 2x\log \left( x \right) + o\left( x \right)</math> where :<math>\vartheta \left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{p \le x} {\log \left( p \right)}</math> for primes <math>p</math>. he established this result by elementary means in march 1948, and by july of that year, selberg and [[paul erdős]] each obtained [[elementary proof]]s of the [[prime number theorem]], both using the asymptotic formula above as a starting point.<ref>{{cite journal|author=spencer, joel|author2=graham, ronald|title=the elementary proof of the prime number

1940s, selberg received the 1950 [[fields medal]].  == institute for advanced study == selberg moved to the united states and settled at the [[institute for advanced study]] in [[princeton, new jersey]] in the 1950s where he remained until his death. during the 1950s he worked on introducing [[spectral theory]] into [[number theory]], culminating in his development of the [[selberg trace formula]], the most famous and influential of his results. in its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of [[closed geodesic]]s on a [[compact riemann surface]] and the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[laplace-beltrami operator|laplacian]], which is analogous to the duality between the [[prime number]]s and the zeros of the zeta function.  he was awarded the 1986 [[wolf prize in mathematics]]. he was also awarded an honorary [[abel prize]] in 2002, its founding year, before the awarding of the regular prizes began.  selberg received many distinctions for his work in addition to the [[fields medal]], the [[wolf prize]] and the [[gunnerus medal]]. he was elected to the [[norwegian academy of science and letters]], the [[royal danish academy of sciences and letters]] and the [[american academy of arts and sciences]].  in 1972 he was awarded an [[honorary degree]], doctor philos. honoris causa, at the [[norwegian institute of technology]], later part of [[norwegian university of science and technology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=honorary doctors at ntnu|publisher=norwegian university of science and
