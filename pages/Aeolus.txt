[[diodorus siculus]] made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear that he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.<ref name="dgrbm">{{citation   | last = schmitz   | first = leonhard   | author-link =    | contribution = aeolus (1), (2) and (3)   | editor-last = smith   | editor-first = william   | title = [[dictionary of greek and roman biography and mythology]]   | volume = 1   | pages = 35   | publisher =    | place =    | year = 1864   | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0044.html }}</ref>  * the first '''[[aeolus (son of hellen)|aeolus]]''', was a son of [[hellen]] and [[eponym]]ous founder of the aeolian race * the second '''[[aeolus (son of poseidon)|aeolus]]''', was a son of [[poseidon]], who led a colony to islands in the [[tyrrhenian sea]]  * the third '''[[aeolus (son of hippotes)|aeolus]]''', was a son of [[hippotes]] who is mentioned in ''[[odyssey]]'' and the ''[[aeneid]]'' as the keeper of the [[anemoi|winds]].  all three men named aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third aeolus, is often ambiguous as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers.  aeolus was also the name of the following minor characters: * '''aeolus''', was a defender of [[thebes, greece|thebes]] against the [[seven against thebes]]. he was killed by [[parthenopeus|parthenopaeus]].<ref>[[statius]].
