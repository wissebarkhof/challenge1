{{affixes}}  an '''affix''' (in modern sense) is a [[morpheme]] that is attached to a word [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] to form a new word or word form. affixes may be [[morphological derivation|derivational]], like english ''-ness'' and ''pre-'', or [[inflection]]al, like english plural ''-s'' and past tense ''-ed''. they are [[bound morpheme]]s by definition; [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es may be [[separable affix]]es. affixations, the linguistic process speakers use form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.  ==positional categories of affixes== affixes are divided into many categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. ''prefix'' and ''suffix'' are extremely common terms. ''infix'' and ''circumfix'' are less so, as they are not important in european languages. the other terms are uncommon.  {| class="wikitable" |+ categories of affixes ! affix !! example !! schema !! description |- | '''[[prefix]]''' || <span style="color:#009900;">un</span>-do || <span style="color:#009900;">prefix</span>-stem || appears before the stem |- | '''[[suffix]]/postfix''' || look-<span style="color:#009900;">ing</span> || stem-<span style="color:#009900;">suffix</span> || appears after the stem |- | '''suffixoid'''<ref>kremer, marion. 1997.

(the '''niʔ''' here is an [[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)  in sentence (2), <span style="color:#009900">"baby"</span> does not appear as a free noun. instead it appears as the lexical suffix <span style="color:#009900">'''-əyəł'''</span> which is affixed to the verb root '''šk’ʷ-''' (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" ([[definiteness|definite]]) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.  ==orthographic affixes== in [[orthography]], the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. for example, [[maya script|maya glyphs]] are generally compounds of a ''main sign'' and smaller ''affixes'' joined at its margins. these are called ''prefixes, superfixes, postfixes,'' and ''subfixes'' according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. a small glyph placed inside another is called an ''infix.''<ref>robert sharer & loa traxler, 2006, ''the ancient maya,'' stanford university press. {{isbn|0-8047-4817-9}}</ref> similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the [[indic alphabets]]. for example, the [[tibetan alphabet]] utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.<ref>[[andrew west (linguist)|andrew west]], [http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2006/09/precomposed-tibetan-part-1-brdarten.html "precomposed tibetan part 1 : brdarten"] ''babelstone,'' september 14, 2006</ref>  ==see also== {{div col|3}} * [[agglutination]] * [[augmentative]] * [[binary prefix]] * [[clitic]] * [[combining form]] * [[concatenation]] * [[diminutive]] * [[english prefixes]] * [[family name affixes]] * [[internet-related prefixes]] * [[marker (linguistics)]] * [[morphological derivation]] * [[separable affix]] * [[si prefix]] * [[stemming]] - affix removal using computer software * [[unpaired word]] * [[word formation]] {{div col end}}  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==bibliography== * {{cite journal|last=gerdts|first=donna b.|year=2003|title=the morphosyntax of halkomelem lexical suffixes|journal=international journal of american linguistics|volume=69|issue=4|pages=345–356|doi=10.1086/382736}} * [[timothy montler|montler, timothy]].
