an '''antianginal''' is any [[medication|drug]] used in the treatment of ''[[angina pectoris]]'', a symptom of [[coronary heart disease|ischaemic heart disease]].  ==examples== drugs used are [[nitrate]]s, [[beta blocker]]s, or [[calcium channel blocker]]s.  ===nitrates=== {{main|nitrovasodilator}} [[nitrate]]s cause [[vasodilation]]<ref name="pmid9875113">{{cite journal |vauthors=pfister m, seiler c, fleisch m, göbel h, lüscher t, meier b |title=nitrate induced coronary vasodilatation: differential effects of sublingual application by capsule or spray |journal=heart |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=365–9 |date=october 1998 |pmid=9875113 |pmc=1728824 |doi= 10.1136/hrt.80.4.365 |url=http://heart.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9875113}}</ref> of the venous capacitance vessels by stimulating the [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] (edrf). used to relieve both exertional and vasospastic angina by allowing venous pooling, reducing the pressure in the ventricles and so reducing wall tension and oxygen requirements in, the heart. short-acting nitrates are used to abort angina attacks that have occurred, while longer-acting nitrates are used in the prophylactic management of the condition.  agents include [[nitroglycerin]] ([[glyceryl trinitrate]]) or [[pentaerythritol tetranitrate]], [[isosorbide dinitrate]] and [[isosorbide mononitrate]].triglycerol nitrate  ===beta blockers=== [[beta blocker]]s are used in the prophylaxis<ref name="pmid17998992">{{cite journal |author=o'rourke st |title=antianginal actions of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists |journal=am j pharm educ |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=95 |date=october 2007 |pmid=17998992 |pmc=2064893 |doi= 10.5688/aj710595|url=}}</ref> of exertional angina by reducing the myocardial oxygen demand below the level that would provoke an angina attack.  they are contraindicated in [[variant angina]] and can precipitate [[heart failure]]. they are also contraindicated in severe asthmatics due to bronchoconstriction, and should be used cautiously in diabetics as they can mask symptoms of [[hypoglycemia]].  agents include either cardioselectives such as [[acebutolol]] or [[metoprolol]], or non-cardioselectives such as [[oxprenolol]] or [[sotalol]].  ===calcium channel blockers=== [[calcium]] [[ion]] (ca<sup>++</sup>) antagonists ([[calcium channel blocker]]s) are used in the treatment of chronic stable angina, and most effectively in the treatment of variant angina (directly preventing coronary artery vasospasm). they are not used in the treatment of unstable angina .  in vitro, they dilate the coronary and peripheral arteries and have negative [[inotropic]] and [[chronotropic]] effects - decreasing [[afterload]], improving myocardial efficiency, reducing [[heart rate]] and improving coronary blood flow. ''in vivo'', the vasodilation and [[hypotension]] trigger the [[baroreceptor]] reflex. therefore, the net effect is the interplay of direct and reflex actions.  * class i agents have the most potent negative inotropic effect and may cause heart failure. * class ii agents do not depress conduction or contractility. * class iii agent has negligible inotropic effect and causes almost no reflex [[tachycardia]].  examples include class i agents (''e.g.'', [[verapamil]]), class ii agents (''e.g.'', [[amlodipine]], [[nifedipine]]), or the class iii agent [[diltiazem]].  [[nifedipine]] is more a potent vasodilator and more effective in angina. it is in the class of [[dihydropyridine]]s and does not affect refrectory period on sa node conduction.  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{major drug groups}} {{adrenergics}} {{vasodilators used in cardiac diseases}} {{nonsympatholytic vasodilatory antihypertensives}}  [[category:antianginals| ]]
