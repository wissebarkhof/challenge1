'''telecommunications in burkina faso''' include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the internet.  radio is the country's most popular communications medium. use of telecommunications in [[burkina faso]] are extremely low, limited due to the low penetration of electricity, even in major cities. there were just 141,400 fixed line phones in use in 2012, in a country with a population of 17.4 million. use of mobile phones has skyrocketed from 1.0 million lines in 2006 to 10 million in 2012. internet use is also low, with only 3.7 users per 100 inhabitants in 2012, just over 643,000 users total. the internet penetration rate in africa as a whole was 16 users per 100 inhabitants in 2013.  ==regulation and control==  the constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and of the [[freedom of the press|press]], and the government generally respects these rights in practice.<ref name=usdos-crhrp-burkinafaso-2012/>  all media are under the administrative and technical supervision of the ministry of communications, which is responsible for developing and implementing government policy on information and communication. the superior council of communication (scc), a semiautonomous body under the office of the president, monitors the content of radio and television programs, newspapers, and internet [[web sites]] to ensure compliance with professional ethics standards and government policy. the scc may summon journalists and issue warnings for subsequent violations. hearings may concern alleged libel, disturbing the peace, inciting violence, or violations of state security.<ref name=usdos-crhrp-burkinafaso-2012/>  journalists occasionally face criminal [[libel]] prosecutions and other forms of harassment and intimidation. in addition to the prohibition against insulting the head of state, the law also prohibits the publication of shocking images and lack of respect for the deceased. although the government does not attempt to impede criticism, some journalists practice [[self-censorship]].<ref name=usdos-crhrp-burkinafaso-2012/>  the burkinabé government, in its telecommunications development strategy, has stated its aim to make telecommunications a [[universal service]] accessible to all. a large portion of this strategy is the privatization of the national telecommunications office (onatel), with an additional focus on a rural telephony promotion project. in 2006 the government sold a 51 percent stake in the national telephone company, onatel, and ultimately planned to retain only a 23 percent stake in the company.<ref name=ciawfb-burkinafaso-2014/>  ==radio and television==  * [[radio broadcasting|radio stations]]: 2 am, 26 fm, and 3 shortwave stations;<ref name=ciawfb-burkinafaso-2008>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080611045303/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uv.html "communications: burkina faso"], ''world factbook'', u.s. central intelligence agency, 15 may 2008. retrieved 11 february 2014 via the internet archive.</ref> state-owned radio runs a national and regional network;
