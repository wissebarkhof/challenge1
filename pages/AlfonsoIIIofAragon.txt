[[dante alighieri]], in [[the divine comedy]], recounts that he saw alfonso's spirit seated outside the gates of [[purgatory]] with the other monarchs whom dante blamed for the chaotic political state of [[europe]] during the 13th century.  ==ancestry== {{ahnentafel top|width=100%}} <center>{{ahnentafel-compact5 |style=font-size: 90%; line-height: 110%; |border=1 |boxstyle=padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; |boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc; |boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9; |boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc; |boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc; |boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe; |1= 1.
