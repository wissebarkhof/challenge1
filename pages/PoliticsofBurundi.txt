19 august 2005.  nkurunziza was the first president chosen through democratic means since the start of the [[burundi civil war|civil war]] in 1993 and was sworn in on 26 august, replacing transitional president [[domitien ndayizeye]].  in november 1995, the presidents of [[burundi]], [[rwanda]], [[uganda]], and [[zaire]] (currently [[democratic republic of congo]]) announced a regional initiative for a negotiated peace in burundi facilitated by former tanzanian president [[julius nyerere]]. in july 1996, former burundian president [[pierre buyoya|buyoya]] returned to power in a [[1996 burundian coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. he declared himself president of a transitional republic, even as he suspended the national assembly, banned opposition groups, and imposed a nationwide curfew. widespread condemnation of the coup ensued, and regional countries imposed economic sanctions pending a return to a constitutional government. buyoya agreed in 1996 to liberalize political parties. nonetheless, fighting between the army and [[hutu]] militias continued. in june 1998, buyoya promulgated a transitional constitution and announced a partnership between the government and the opposition-led national assembly. after facilitator julius nyerere's death in october 1999, the regional leaders appointed [[nelson mandela]] as [[facilitator]] of the [[arusha]] peace process. under mandela the peace process has revived and important progress has taken place.  in april 2015 the [[2015 burundian unrest]] broke out after the ruling party announced president [[pierre nkurunziza]] would seek a third term in office. protests in the capital lasted over a week, and while president nkurunziza was in tanzania for talks at resolving the situation, major general [[godefroid niyombare]] declared a coup, leading to gun battles in the capital for control of key locations.  ==executive branch== {{office-table}} |[[rulers and heads of state of burundi|president]] |[[pierre
