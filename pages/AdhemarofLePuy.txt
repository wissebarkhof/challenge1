however, he was willing to let the crusader army believe it was real if it raised their morale.  adhemar was protected by a band of crusaders led by [[henry of esch]] to preserve the (albeit suspect) relic.  when kerbogha was defeated, adhemar organized a council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes, but he died on 1 august 1098,{{sfn|chisholm|1911}} probably of [[typhus]]. the disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved and the march to [[jerusalem]] was delayed for months. however, the lower-class soldiers continued to think of adhemar as a leader. some of them claimed to have been visited by his ghost during the [[siege of jerusalem (1099)|siege of jerusalem]] and reported that adhemar instructed them to hold another procession around the walls. this was done and jerusalem was taken by the crusaders in 1099.  ==references== {{reflist}}  ===sources=== *{{eb1911|wstitle=adhemar de monteil|volume=1|page=192}} *{{cite book | editor-last=peters | editor-first=edward | title=the first crusade | publisher=university of pennsylvania press | location=philadelphia | isbn=0812210174 | year=1971 }} *murray, alan v., [http://www.persee.fr/docaspdf/rbph_0035-0818_1992_num_70_2_3824.pdf "the army of godfrey of bouillon, 1096–1099: structure and dynamics of a contingent on the first crusade" (pdf)], revue belge de philologie et d'histoire, 1992 *runciman, steven, a history of the crusades, volume i:  the first crusade and the foundation of the kingdom of jerusalem, cambridge university press, cambridge, 1951 *riley-smith, the first crusaders, 1095-1131, cambridge university press, cambridge, 1997 *[http://fmg.ac/projects/medlands/lotharingian%20(upper)%20nobility.htm#_toc447794452 medieval lands project, herren von esch] *edgington, susan, albert of aachen: historia ierosolimitana, history of the journey to jerusalem, clarendon press, 2007 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=29ivdupwbj8c&pg=pa166&lpg=pa166&dq=turbaisel&source=bl&ots=hdc2brvwmk&sig=40lsrcakdcmenrz4omrqf52phxu&hl=en&sa=x&ved=0ahukewiz9dezi_nnahvi5mmkhvrobrmq6aeiitaa#v=onepage&q=turbaisel&f=false available on google books])  == external links == * medieval sourcebook: [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2-5vers.html speech by urban ii at council of clermont, 1095 (five versions of the speech)]  {{authority control}}  {{defaultsort:puy, adhemar of le}} [[category:christians of the first crusade]] [[category:11th-century roman catholic bishops]] [[category:bishops of le puy-en-velay]] [[category:1098 deaths]] [[category:year of birth unknown]]
