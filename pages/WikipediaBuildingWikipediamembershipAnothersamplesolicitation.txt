{{historical}}  i am only now starting to publicize wikipedia, a wiki-based free (open content) encyclopedia project.  we started last january and already have about 10,000 articles.  perhaps you have seen us by now--we're located at http://www.wikipedia.com . i'm the person responsible for organizing and leading wikipedia, as well as nupedia (which has been moving *much* more slowly).  first things first: it would be fantastic if you would like to link to any or all of our articles.  they're free, of course.  i'd like to make this as easy as possible for you, if you're interested.  if you have any free articles we can use, i would like to know about it!  more interestingly, perhaps, for you, is the idea that you can actually use our content as part of your website.  it's free.  the cream of the crop can be found at http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?brilliant_prose , but there's a *lot* more than that.  also, the quality of nupedia articles is guaranteed; see http://www.nupedia.com/newest.phtml .  (there just isn't much there yet.)  one thing we're working on is a program that will make it extremely easy to mirror wikipedia's content.  we're not done with that yet--but is that something you might be interested in?  i certainly would like to hear back from you about how we might be able to support each other.  i do not regard your website as a competitor in any sense at all.  :''see also :'' [[wikipedia:building wikipedia membership|building wikipedia membership]]
