{{historical}} hello!  i would like to exchange links with you, if that's possible.  wikipedia and nupedia are free, open content encyclopedias.  wikipedia now has about 10,000 articles, including many in the life sciences, and nupedia's (peer reviewed) biology category is its most active.  wikipedia would be happy to include a link to the encyclopedia of life sciences on our "friends of wikipedia" page.  wikipedia now receives something like 2,000 unique visitors a day, and we started in january; this e-mail is part of a drive to increase traffic, and so we expect traffic will increase greatly, particularly as we are growing by over 1,000 articles per month.  (these articles, both wikipedia's and nupedia's, are, by the way, free for you to use as you wish, with no fee--see our open content license.)  best regards,  larry sanger  :''see also :'' [[wikipedia:building wikipedia membership|building wikipedia membership]]
