[[file:box-cutter.jpg|thumb|right|segmented blade or "snap-off blade" utility knife]] another style is a snap-off utility knife that contains a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. as the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. the snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built-in, or a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. when all of the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a replacement blade. this design was introduced by japanese manufacturer [[olfa]] corporation in 1956 as the world's first snap-off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments.  [[file:boxcutter.jpg|thumb|right|inexpensive stamped steel and aluminum box cutter with disposable razor blade.]] another utility knife often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which [[razor#other razors|single-edge utility blades]] can be inserted.  the sleeve slides up and down on the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use.  the blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife.  the blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of [[corrugated fiberboard]], to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.  ==use as weapon== {{see also|airport security repercussions due to the september 11 attacks}} most utility knives are not well suited to use as offensive weapons, with the exception of some outdoor-type utility knives employing longer blades.  however, even small razor-blade type utility knives may sometimes find use as slashing weapons. the [[9/11 commission|9-11 commission]] report stated passengers in cell phone calls reported knives or "box-cutters" were used as weapons, (also mace or a bomb),  in hi-jacking airplanes in the [[september 11 attacks|september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] against the united states, though the exact design of the knives used is unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/|title=national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states|website=www.9-11commission.gov|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911report.pdf|title=the 9/11 commission report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> two of the hijackers were known to have purchased [[leatherman]] knives, which feature a 4" locking blade which were not prohibited on u.s. flights at the time. those knives were not found in the possessions the two hijackers left behind.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/us/01/27 9/11 panel: hijackers may have had utility knives], ''[[cnn]]'', mike m. ahlers, january 27, 2004. retrieved 30 may 2016.</ref> similar cutters, including [[paper cutters]], have also been known to be used as a lethal weapon.<ref>{{cite news|last1=chong|first1=elena|title=death in yishun flat: woman remanded for psychiatric assessment|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/death-in-yishun-flat-woman-remanded-for-psychiatric-assessment|accessdate=1 december 2015|publisher=straits times}}</ref>  small work-type utility knives have also been used to commit robbery and other crimes. in june 2004, a japanese [[sasebo slashing|student was slashed to death]] with a segmented-type utility knife.  in the united kingdom, the law was changed{{when|date=july 2017}} to raise the age limit for purchasing knives, including utility knives, from 16 to 18.<ref>https://www.gov.uk/find-out-if-i-can-buy-or-carry-a-knife</ref>  ==see also== *[[automatic box-opening technology]]  ==references== {{reflist}}  {{commons category|utility knives|position=left}}  {{knives}} {{cutting and abrasive tools}}  {{defaultsort:utility knife}} [[category:knives]] [[category:woodworking hand tools]] [[category:office equipment]]
