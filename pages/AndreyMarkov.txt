[[file:andrei markov.jpg|right|thumb|alt=markov in 1886|markov in 1886]] one year after the defense of his doctoral thesis, markov was appointed extraordinary professor (1886) and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the academy of sciences. in 1890, after the death of viktor bunyakovsky, markov became an extraordinary member of the academy. his promotion to an ordinary professor of st. petersburg university followed in the fall of 1894.  in 1896, markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of [[chebyshev]]. in 1905, he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire, which he did immediately. until 1910, however, he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences.  in connection with student riots in 1908, professors and lecturers of st. petersburg university were ordered to monitor their students. markov refused to accept this decree, and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an "agent of the governance". markov was removed from further teaching duties at st. petersburg university, and hence he decided to retire from the university.  markov was an [[atheist]]. in 1912 he protested [[leo tolstoy]]'s excommunication from the [[russian orthodox church]] by requesting his own excommunication. the church complied with his request.<ref>"of course, markov, an atheist and eventual excommunicate of the church quarreled endlessly with his equally outspoken counterpart nekrasov. the disputes between markov and nekrasov were not limited to mathematics and religion, they quarreled over political and philosophical issues as well."  gely p. basharin, amy n. langville, valeriy a. naumov, [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20121218173228/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/meyn/www/spm_files/markov-work-and-life.pdf the life and work of a. a. markov], page 6.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=naming infinity: a true story of religious mysticism and mathematical creativity|year=2009|publisher=harvard university press|isbn=978-0-674-03293-4|author1=loren r. graham|author2=jean-michel kantor|page=69|quote=markov (1856–1922), on the other hand, was an atheist and a strong critic of the orthodox church and the tzarist government (nekrasov exaggeratedly called him a marxist).}}</ref>  [[file:literator bridges grave markov.jpg|right|thumb|alt=markov's headstone|markov's [[headstone]]]] in 1913, the council of st. petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university. markov was among them, but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education. the affirmation only occurred four years later, after the [[february revolution]] in 1917. markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in 1922.  == see also == {{div col||20em}} * [[chebyshev–markov–stieltjes inequalities]] * [[gauss–markov theorem]] * [[gauss–markov process]] * [[hidden markov model]] * [[markov blanket]] * [[markov chain]] * [[markov decision process]] * [[markov's inequality]] * [[markov information source]] * [[markov random field|markov network]] * [[markov number]] * [[markov property]] * [[markov process]] * [[stochastic matrix]] (also known as markov matrix) * [[subjunctive possibility]] {{div col end}}  == notes == {{reflist}}  == references == * {{cite book|author=karl-georg steffens|title=the history of approximation theory: from euler to bernstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijfjnoq638kc&pg=pa98|date=28 july 2007|publisher=springer science & business media|isbn=978-0-8176-4475-8|pages=98–105}} * а. а. марков.
