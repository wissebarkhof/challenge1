[[queen charlotte sound (new zealand)|queen charlotte sound]] defines its western side, while to the south lies [[tory channel]], which is on the sea route from [[wellington]] in the [[north island]] to [[picton, new zealand|picton]]. [[cook strait]]'s narrowest point is between arapaoa island's perano head and [[cape terawhiti]] in the north island.  ==history== according to [[māori mythology|māori oral tradition]], the island was where the great navigator [[kupe]] killed the octopus [[te wheke-a-muturangi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theprow.org.nz/maori/geographic-names-tetauihu/ |title=new and altered geographic names of te tau ihu |year=2014 |website=theprow.org.nz |publisher= |accessdate=7 november 2015}}</ref>  it was from a hill on arapaoa island in 1770 that captain [[james cook]] first saw the sea passage from the [[pacific ocean]] to the [[tasman sea]], which was named [[cook strait]].  this discovery banished the fond notion of geographers that there existed a great southern continent, [[terra australis]].  a monument at cook's lookout was erected in 1970.  from the late 1820s until the mid-1960s, arapaoa island was a base for [[whaling]] in the sounds. [[john guard]] established a shore station at te awaiti in 1827 for [[right whales]]. later, the station at perano head on the east coast of the island was used to hunt [[humpback whales]] from 1911 to 1964 (see [[whaling in new zealand]]). the houses built by the perano family are now operated as tourist accommodations.  in august 2014, the spelling of the island's name was officially altered from ''arapawa'' to ''arapaoa''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/regulatory/place-names/recent-place-name-decisions-and-place-names-interest/nzgb-decisions-august |title=nzgb decisions |date=august 2014 |website= |publisher=land information new zealand |accessdate=7 november 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121203027/http://www.linz.govt.nz/regulatory/place-names/recent-place-name-decisions-and-place-names-interest/nzgb-decisions-august |archivedate=21 november 2015 }}</ref>  ===aircraft accident=== an elevated power cable from the mainland to arapaoa island over [[tory channel]] was struck by an air albatross [[cessna 402]] commuter aircraft in 1985. the crash was witnessed by many passengers on an inter-island cook strait ferry. the ferry immediately stopped to dispatch a rescue lifeboat. along with the two pilots, one entire family was lost, and all but a young girl from the other. no bodies were ever found. the sole survivor (cindy mosey) was travelling with her family and the other from nelson to wellington to attend a gymnastics competition. the arapaoa island crash caused public confidence in air albatross to falter, contributing to the company going into liquidation in december of that year.  ==conservation== parts of the island have been heavily cleared of native vegetation in the past through burning and logging, a number of pine forests were planted on the island.<ref>{{cite journal|last=meurk|first=c. d|author2=ward j.c. |author3=jane g. |author4=walls g.y. |year=1999|title=arapawa island: flora and ecological notes |journal=canterbury botanical society |issue=33 |pages=77–98 |url=http://bts.nzpcn.org.nz/bts_pdf/cant_1999_33__77-98.pdf }}</ref> [[wilding conifer|wilding pines]], an [[invasive species]] in some parts of new zealand, are being poisoned on the island to allow the regenerating native vegetation to grow. about {{convert|200|ha}} at ruaomoko point on the south-eastern portion of the island will be killed by drilling holes into the trees and injecting poison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/6962568/tree-poisoning-work-for-island|title=tree poisoning work for island |last=nicoll |first=jared |date=22 june 2012|work=the marlborough express|accessdate=24 february 2013}}</ref>  arapaoa island is known for the breeds of [[arapawa pig|pigs]], [[arapawa sheep|sheep]] and [[arapawa goat|goats]] found only on the island. these became established in the 19th century, but the origin of these breeds is uncertain, and a matter of some speculation. common suggestions are that they are old english breeds introduced by the early whalers, or by captain cook or other early explorers.  these breeds are now extinct in england, and the goats surviving in a sanctuary on the island are now also bred in other parts of new zealand and in the northern hemisphere.  == see also == * [[list of islands of new zealand]]  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==external links== * [http://www.rarebreeds.co.nz/arapawagoat.html arapawa goats] * [http://www.rarebreeds.co.nz/arapawapigs.html arapawa pigs] * [http://www.rarebreeds.co.nz/arapawa.html arapawa sheep]  [[category:islands of the marlborough region]] [[category:whaling stations]] [[category:whaling in new zealand]] [[category:marlborough sounds]] [[category:cook strait ferry]]
