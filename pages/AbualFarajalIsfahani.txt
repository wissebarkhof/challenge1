direct descendant of the last of the [[umayyad]] [[caliph]]s, [[marwan ii]], and was thus connected with the umayyad rulers in [[al-andalus]], and seems to have kept up a correspondence with them and to have sent them some of his works. he became famous for his knowledge of early arabian antiquities.<ref name="eb">{{eb1911|inline=1|wstitle=abulfaraj|volume=1|page=79}}</ref>  his later life was spent in various parts of the islamic world, in [[aleppo]] with its [[hamdanid]] governor [[sayf ad-dawlah]] (to whom he dedicated the ''book of songs''), in [[ray, iran|ray]] with the [[buwayhid]] [[vizier]] [[ibn 'abbad]], and elsewhere.  although he wrote [[poetry]], also an anthology of verses on the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[mesopotamia]] and [[egypt]], and a genealogical work, his fame rests upon his ''book of songs'' ([[kitab al-aghani]]).<ref name="eb" />  ==''book of songs''== ''[[kitab al-aghani]]'' (''book of songs''), a twenty volumes work that relates the stories of
