{{about|a fictional communication device||ansible (disambiguation)}}  an '''ansible''' is a category of [[fiction|fictional]] device or technology capable of [[instantaneous]] or [[faster-than-light communication]]. it can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay. the term ansible is broadly shared across works of several science fiction authors, settings and continuities.  == origin == [[ursula k. le guin]] [[neologism|coined]] the word ''ansible'' in her 1966 novel ''[[rocannon's world]]''.<ref>bernardo, susan m. & murphy, graham j. ''ursula k. le guin: a critical companion'' (westport, ct: greenwood press, 2006), page 18.</ref> the word is a contraction of "answerable", as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over [[interstellar communication|interstellar]] distances.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-ans1.htm|work= world wide words|title= ansible|last= quinion|first= michael}}</ref> her award-winning 1974 novel ''[[the dispossessed]]'', a book in the [[hainish cycle]], tells of the invention of the ansible.<ref name="dispossessed">{{cite book | last = le guin | first = ursula k. | authorlink = ursula k. le guin | title = the dispossessed | origyear = june 1974 | edition = mass ppb. |date=august 2001 | publisher = eos/[[harpercollins]] | location = new york | isbn = 0-06-105488-7 | page = 276 | quote = 'they print reumere's plans for the ansible.'
