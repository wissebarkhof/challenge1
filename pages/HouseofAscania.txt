[[catherine ii of russia|catherine the great]], empress of russia from 1762–1796, was a member of the house of ascania, herself the daughter of [[christian august, prince of anhalt-zerbst]].  ==list of states ruled by the house of ascania== {{ducal family of anhalt}} * county, principality, and duchy of [[principality of anhalt|anhalt]]: c. 1100–1918 * [[duchy of saxony|duchy]] and [[electorate of saxony]]: 1112, 1139–1142, 1180–1422 * county of [[weimar-orlamünde]]: 1112–1486 * [[margravate of brandenburg]]: 1157–1320 * [[duchy of saxe-lauenburg]]: 1269–1689 * [[principality of lüneburg]]: 1369–1388 * principality and duchy of [[anhalt-bernburg]]: 1252–1468 and 1603–1863 * [[principality of anhalt-zerbst]]: 1252–1396 and 1544–1796 * [[principality of anhalt-aschersleben]]: 1252–1315 * principality and duchy of [[anhalt-köthen]]: 1396–1561 and 1603–1847 * principality and duchy of [[anhalt-dessau]] 1396–1561 and 1603–1863 * [[principality of anhalt-plötzkau]] 1544–1553 and 1603–1665 * principality of [[anhalt-harzgerode]] 1635–1709 * principality of anhalt-mühlingen: 1667–1714 * [[principality of anhalt-dornburg]]: 1667–1742 * principality of [[anhalt-bernburg-schaumburg-hoym]]: 1718–1812 * [[russian empire]]: 1762–1796  ==references== * [http://susi.e-technik.uni-ulm.de:8080/meyers2/seite/werk/brockhaus/band/50/seite/0992/brockhaus_b50_s0992.html ''askanien'', meyers konversationslexikon, 1888] * trillmich, werner, ''kaiser konrad ii. und seine zeit'', bonn, 1991  ==external links== {{commonscat|house of ascania}} *[http://www.anhalt-askanien.de/ ducal family of anhalt (house of ascania)]] - official website *{{cite web |last=marek |first=miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/ascania/ascan1.html |title= genealogy.eu: house of ascania |publisher= genealogy.eu}} (first page of a series) *[http://www.stirnet.com/genie/data/continent/bb/brandenburg1.php#top stirnet: brandenburg1] {{subscription required}} (genealogy of the houses of ascania and brandenburg, including the most likely ancestry of the 11th-century house of ascania) *[http://www.stirnet.com/genie/data/ancient/ae/ascania1.php#top stirnet: ascania1] {{subscription required}} (an alternate possible ancestry of the 11th-century house of ascania)   {{royal houses of europe}}  {{authority control}}  {{defaultsort:ascania, house of}} [[category:house of ascania|*]] [[category:european royal families]] [[category:saxon nobility]]
