use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.<ref

2016}}  more specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  affection is compared with passion, from the greek "[[pathos]]". as such it appears in the writings of [[france|french]] philosopher [[rené descartes]], [[netherlands|dutch]] philosopher [[baruch spinoza]], and most of the writings of early british ethicists.  however, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.  in this narrower sense the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligation.  for a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary, see [[henry sidgwick|h. sidgwick]], ''methods of ethics'' pp.&nbsp;345–349.<ref name="eb1911"/>  ==expression==  {{further information|public display of affection}} affection can be communicated by words, gestures, or touches. affectionate behavior may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards.<ref>according to [[communication]] professor kory floyd of the [[university of arizona]]</ref> such affection has been shown to influence brain development in infants.<ref>infant observation: international journal of infant observation and its applications</ref>  expressions of affection can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. if welcomed, affectionate behavior  may be associated with  various health benefits. it has been proposed that positive sentiment increases the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiment among them.<ref>{{cite

different cultural societies. for example, in the [[manchu people|manchu]] ethnic group, mothers publicly kissing their infant is viewed as inappropriate, while publicly performing [[fellatio]]  on their infant son is considered an appropriate act of affection.<ref>{{cite book | last=clarke | first=john r. | title=looking at lovemaking | year=2001 |
