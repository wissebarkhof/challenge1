7 may 1553, in [[königsberg]] &ndash; 28 august 1618, in [[fischhausen]], rybaki) was [[duke of prussia]] from 1568 until his death.  he was a son of [[albert of prussia]] and [[anna marie of brunswick-lüneburg]]. he was the second and last prussian duke of the [[ansbach]] branch of the [[hohenzollern]] family.  ==duke of prussia== albert became duke of prussia after paying [[homage (feudal)|feudal homage]] to the [[king of poland]], [[zygmunt august]] (ducal prussia was a fief of poland), on july 19, 1569 in [[lublin]].<ref name=lancizolle>{{cite book|last=carl wilhelm von lancizolle|title=geschichte der bildung des preussischen staats. erster theil, volumes 1-2|year=1828|publisher=nicolaischen buchhandlung|location=berlin and stettin|pages=474|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mn4raqaaiaaj&pg=pa474}}</ref>  the homage was described by the polish chronicler [[jan kochanowski]] in his work ''proporzec'' ("standard"). during the 1573 polish election, albert frederick attempted to gain acceptance to the polish [[senate]] but was opposed by the powerful [[jan zamoyski]] (later grand [[hetman]] of the [[crown of the kingdom of poland]]) who feared the influence of [[protestants]] in the polish legislative body. albert frederick initially refused to recognize the election of [[stefan bathory]] and supported the candidacy of [[maximilian ii, holy roman emperor|maximilian of habsburg]]. however, at the [[toruń]] [[sejm]] of october 1576 he gave his support to the new monarch.  as the great grandson of the polish king [[casimir iv jagiellon]], and as a duke in prussia who was fluent in polish, albert frederick was seriously considered for a time as a possible candidate for the polish throne. he particularly enjoyed the support of polish [[lutherans]].  in 1572 he began to exhibit signs of mental disorder. in early 1578, the regency was taken over by his cousin, [[george frederick, margrave of brandenburg-ansbach|george frederick of brandenburg-kulmbach]] (1539–1603). after george frederick's death in 1603, the polish king [[sigismund iii vasa]] appointed [[joachim iii frederick, elector of brandenburg|joachim frederick]] as regent in 1605, and permitted his son, [[john sigismund, elector of brandenburg|john sigismund]], to succeed him in 1611. the latter became duke of prussia after albert frederick's death in 1618.<ref name=stone>{{cite book|last=stone|first=daniel|title=a history of east central europe|year=2001|publisher=university of washington press|location=seattle|isbn=9780295980935|pages=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lfgb_l4sdhac&pg=pa143}}</ref>  ==marriage== albert frederick was married in 1573 to [[marie eleonore of cleves]], a daughter of [[wilhelm, duke of jülich-cleves-berg]] and [[maria of habsburg, archduchess of austria|archduchess maria of austria]] (1531&ndash;1581). maria was a daughter of [[ferdinand i, holy roman emperor]] and [[anna of bohemia and hungary]].  ==issue== albert frederick and marie were parents to seven children: # [[duchess anna of prussia|anna of prussia]] (3 july 1576 &ndash;
