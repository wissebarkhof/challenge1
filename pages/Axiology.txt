[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 axiology—theory of values]. ''philosophy and phenomenological research''.</ref>  axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct.  aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." '''formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[robert s. hartman]]'s [[science of value]].  ==history== between the 5th and 6th century bc, it was important in greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[socrates]] held the belief that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[socrates]]' student, [[plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all.  with the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped christianity. during the medieval times, [[thomas aquinas]] argued for a separation between natural and religious virtues.  this concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.<ref name="autogenerated70">arneson, p.
