[[michael praetorius]] mentions an alphorn-like instrument under the name of hölzern trummet (wooden trumpet) in ''syntagma musicum'' (wittenberg, 1615–1619; pl. viii).<ref name="eb1911">{{eb1911|inline=y|wstitle=alpenhorn, alphorn|volume=1|page=723|first=kathleen|last=schlesinger|authorlink=kathleen schlesinger}}</ref>  the alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure [[harmonic series (music)|natural harmonic series]] of the open pipe.<ref name="eb1911"/> the notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard western [[equal temperament]]. most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale. [[image:harmonic series.png|thumb|center|600px]]  accomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves, consisting of the 2nd through the 16th notes of the harmonic series. the availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn.  [[image:alphorn-mj.jpg|thumb|right|d'dieß'ner alphorn players.]] the well-known "[[ranz des vaches]]" ([https://web.archive.org/web/19980214205945/http://www.lyoba.ch/culture/desalpe/ranz.htm#partition score]; [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?sid=7020216&ckey=1183635931000&ty=st&rubricid=25004&sitesect=25001 audio]) is a traditional swiss melody often heard on the alphorn. the song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. [[gioachino rossini|rossini]] introduced the "ranz des vaches" into his masterpiece ''william tell,'' along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well-suited to the alphorn. [[johannes brahms|brahms]] wrote to [[clara schumann]] that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his [[symphony no. 1 (brahms)|first symphony]] was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the rigi area of switzerland.  ==music for alphorn== [[image:fanfare 27bca 01.jpg|thumb|the military band of the french [[chasseurs alpins]] uses alphorns.]] among music composed for the alphorn:  *"concerto grosso no. 1" (2013) for four alphorns and orchestra by [[georg friedrich haas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universaledition.com/georg-friedrich-haas/composers-and-works/composer/278 |title=georg friedrich haas |publisher=universal edition |date=1953-08-16 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eamdc.com/news/bavarian-radio-symphony-orchestra-debuts-concerto-grosso-nr-1-by-georg-friedrich-haas/ |title=eam: georg friedrich haas's concerto grosso no. 1 debuts with bavarian radio symphony orchestra |publisher=eamdc.com |date=2014-02-25 |accessdate=2016-12-28}}</ref> *''sinfonia pastorella for alphorn and string orchestra'' (1755)  by [[leopold mozart]] *''concerto for alphorn and orchestra'' (1970) by [[jean daetwyler]] *''concerto for alphorn no. 2'' (with flute, string orchestra & percussion) (1983) by daetwyler *''dialogue with nature for alphorn, flute & orchestra'' by daetwyler *''concertino rustico'' (1977) by [[ferenc farkas]] *''begegnung'' for 3 alphorns and concert band, by kurt gable. *''säumerweg-blues'' [http://real.xobix.ch/ramgen/swissinfo/swissalpinemusic/2006/kurtott_saeumerwegblues.rm (audio played by kurt ott)]{{dead link|date=july 2017 |bot=internetarchivebot |fix-attempted=yes }} among many compositions by hans-jürg sommer, [http://www.alphornmusik.ch alphorn musik] *''messe für alphorn und chor'' by franz schüssele [http://www.alphorn-center.de alphorn-center] *''wolf music: tapio for alphorn and echoing instruments'' (2003) by [[r. murray schafer]]<ref>http://www.yorku.ca/caml/en/review/31-1/schafer.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004044636/http://www.yorku.ca/caml/en/review/31-1/schafer.htm |date=4 october 2012 }}</ref> *''bob downes & the alphorn brothers'' (2015) by bob downes open music (cd rec. 2004) *very possibly described as a lituus in bb: [http://www3.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/cantata_bwv_118_-_o_jesu_christ,_meins_lebens_licht_(johann_sebastian_bach) cantata bwv 118 - o jesu christ, meins lebens licht (johann sebastian bach)]  ==in popular culture== the alphorn is prominently featured in television advertisements for [[ricola]] cough drops, which are manufactured in switzerland.  ==see also== * [[bucium]], a type of alphorn used by mountain dwellers in [[romania]] * [[didgeridoo]] * [[erke]], a similar instrument of argentine northwest * [[kuhreihen]], a type of melody played on an alphorn * [[tibetan horn]] * [[trembita]], a [[ukrainian folk music|ukrainian]] alpine horn made of wood  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== * bachmann-geiser, brigitte, ''das alphorn: vom lock- zum rockinstrument''. paul haupt, berne, 1999. {{isbn|3-258-05640-4}} * franz schüssele, ''alphorn und hirtenhorn in europa'', book and cd with 63 sound samples available at [http://www.alphorn-center.de alphorn-center], {{isbn|3-927-78121-5}}  ==external links== {{commons category|alphorns|alphorn}} * [http://www.wabashplaindealer.com/articles/2009/08/21/local_news/local5.txt midwest alphorn retreat] first event held july 2009, lagro, indiana * [https://web.archive.org/web/20100807080633/http://www.salzburgerecho.com/seminars.html third annual north american alphorn retreat] * [http://www.alphorninconcert.ch alphorn in concert] concert and composition contest taking place annually in oensingen, canton solothurn, switzerland * [http://www.nendazcordesalpes.ch international alphorn festival] at nendaz, canton valais, switzerland * [http://www.vsp-orkestra.com/index.php?lang=2 vsp orkestra & arkady shilkloper]  {{musical instruments |state=autocollapse}} {{natural horns}}  {{authority control}}  [[category:national symbols of switzerland]] [[category:swiss musical instruments]] [[category:natural horns and trumpets]]
